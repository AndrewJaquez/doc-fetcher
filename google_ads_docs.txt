## Prerequisites

To make a Google Ads API call, you should have the following details. The rest of this
tutorial teaches you how to obtain each of these items.
Google Ads manager account: You need a Google Ads
manager account to apply for the Google Ads API.
Developer token: This token lets your app connect to the
Google Ads API. Each developer token is assigned an API access level which
controls the number of API calls you can make per day with as well as the
environment to which you can make calls.

Google API Console project: The Google API Console project is used
for generating OAuth 2.0 credentials for your app. The app will then use
these credentials to authenticate the user and obtain user authorization to
manage their Google Ads accounts. This authorization is later used by your app
to make API calls to the Google Ads account. The project also enables the API
to accept calls.

Google Ads client account: This is the account you're making API
calls against. You need necessary permissions to operate on this account,
such as fetching reports or making changes to campaigns.
You also need the 10-digit account number of the account you're making API
calls to. This is displayed in the Google Ads web interface in the form
123-456-7890. This account number is passed as a parameter to the Google Ads API
call without the hyphens: 1234567890.

--------------------------------------------------
Google Ads API

# Obtain a developer token



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The developer token is a 22-character long alphanumeric string that lets
your app connect to the Google Ads API. After the token is assigned to you by Google,
you can view it or create a new one on the API Center page of your Google Ads
manager account.
Each developer token is assigned an access level which
controls the number of API calls you can make per day with the token, as well
as the environment to which you can make calls.
To make API calls against your production account, you must request
Basic Access level or Standard Access level for your developer token
during the token application process. Since these access levels are not required
to make calls against test accounts, you can proceed with the exercises, but
you're encouraged to check out how to apply for Basic
Access level after you've completed this guide.

## Do you need a new developer token?

Whether you should sign up for a new developer token or not depends on a few
factors. Here are some common scenarios:
Your company has never used the Google Ads API before and you want to develop
     your own apps
Sign up for a new developer token. Learn more
Your company is actively using or has used the Google Ads API in the past
Google usually grants one developer token per company, so if your company
      already uses the Google Ads API, then you should reuse your existing developer
      token. Learn more
Your company already uses the Google Ads API but is also developing a new
      product or tool
If you're certain that you cannot use your existing developer token, then
      you can apply for a new one explaining your use case in the application.
      For the rest of this guide, you can use your existing developer
      token. Learn more
Your company uses a third-party app
You need a developer token only if you're developing your own app. If you
      use a third-party app or service, then the developer of that app needs to
      get a developer token for the app. If you're unclear about your case,
      contact
      the API compliance team.

## How to apply for a developer token

There are two steps when applying for a developer token.

### Step 1: Select or create a Google Ads manager account

If you already have a Google Ads manager account, select it when applying for the
token. If this manager account is not already linked to your other accounts, we
recommend putting it at the root of your account hierarchy to ease the token
review process and simplify account management later on.
If you don't have a manager account, you can follow the Help Center
instructions to create one.

### Step 2: Apply for access to the Google Ads API

Note that the developer token review process can take some time to complete.

Test Account Access level and you can start making API calls against test
accounts.
After you've obtained your developer token, note its value as you will require
it when making your first API call.

## Verify if you are signed into a manager account

You must sign in to your manager account to access your developer token, and it
cannot be a test manager account.
To verify if you are signed in to the manager account, follow these steps:
Navigate to
https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter
in your web browser.

# Set up a Google API Console project



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

You need a Google API Console project for creating OAuth 2.0 credentials, and
enabling the Google Ads API for your app.
The credentials are needed for the authentication and authorization of Google Ads
users by Google servers. These credentials let you generate OAuth tokens to be
used in calls to the API.
Although you can use a single developer token for multiple projects, each
project can use only a single developer token.

## Select or create a Google API Console project

Follow the instructions 
to create a project. Enabling billing for your project 
is optional. If you have billing enabled, select a billing account for the new
project. There is no charge for using the Google Ads API, but there is a quota on the
total number of Cloud projects.

## Enable the Google Ads API in your project

To enable the Google Ads API in your project, follow these steps:
Open the API Library in the Google API Console. If prompted, select your
project or create a new one. The API Library lists all available
APIs, grouped by product family and popularity.

In this step, you identify a Google Ads account to make API calls to. The account
can either be a production (live) account or a test account. Each approach has
its advantages and disadvantages.
Production accounts

Disadvantages

##### Disadvantages

A programming bug in the development phase could affect live
         campaign serving, leading to issues such as poor campaign performance,
         incorrect serving, or financial losses.
The developer token should have at least the Basic Access level to
         in order to make API calls.

         in order to make API calls.
You must reconstruct campaigns within test accounts to test code
         that works against specific account contents.
Since test accounts don't serve ads, features related to live serving
         such as reporting stats, policy violation errors, or processing offline
         conversion imports are not supported, making it difficult to test those
         features.

         such as reporting stats, policy violation errors, or processing offline
         conversion imports are not supported, making it difficult to test those
         features.
We recommend using a test account while developing your application when
possible. For instructions, see Create test accounts and
campaigns.
An alternative is to set up a production account with a low account budget,
such as $1/day, explicitly for testing features that are not supported by a
test account.

## Choice of feature set

When choosing an account for making API call, an additional consideration is
the list of features you'd want to use with the API. Even if you choose to use
a production account, there are some features that are account-specific, for
example:
For billing features, you need an account that is on monthly invoicing.
Some new features in the account might be restricted by allowlists.
Before finalizing the account to make API calls against, check the
documentation of the specific feature to make sure that the feature doesn't
have additional restrictions.

## Identify the login customer ID and customer ID

To make an API call to a Google Ads customer, you must grant access and
appropriate permissions to your service account to the customer account
either directly or through a linked manager account. To do this, you need
administrator access to the customer account.
Start by signing in to your Google Ads account as an administrator. In some cases,
you might have more than one customer account to choose from. The account you
select establishes the login customer ID, which is a required header for some
API calls.
After you've identified the Google Ads customer to make API calls to, note the
following details:
The 10-digit customer ID of the customer account to which you plan to make
API calls against. This is sometimes referred to as the operating customer.
The 10-digit customer ID of the customer account to which you plan to make
API calls against. This is sometimes referred to as the operating customer.
The 10-digit login customer ID of the customer account you're signed in to.
If you're signed in to the operating customer, the login customer ID is the
same as the customer ID. If you signed into a manager account of the
operating customer, the login customer ID is the customer ID of the manager
account.
The 10-digit login customer ID of the customer account you're signed in to.
If you're signed in to the operating customer, the login customer ID is the
same as the customer ID. If you signed into a manager account of the
operating customer, the login customer ID is the customer ID of the manager
account.

## Grant access to the service account

While signed in to your Google Ads account as an administrator, navigate to
Admin > Access and security.
While signed in to your Google Ads account as an administrator, navigate to
Admin > Access and security.
Click the + button under the Users tab.
Click the + button under the Users tab.

# Access Levels and Permissible Use



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Each Google Ads API developer token is assigned an access level and "permissible
use". The access level determines whether you can affect production accounts
and the number of operations and requests that you can execute daily.
Permissible use determines the specific Google Ads API features that the
developer token is allowed to use.

## Access levels

There are three different access levels listed in order in the table. If you
don't already have Google Ads API access, you can start by signing
up to obtain test account access.
You can increase the access level by completing some additional steps in the
application.
Test Account Access
Test accounts
15,000 operations / day
Instructions
Basic Access
Test and production accounts
15,000 operations / day
Instructions
Standard Access
Test and production accounts
Unlimited operations / day
Instructions
1 "Per day" is based on a sliding 24 hour time period in which API
requests were made with your developer token. Your application will receive an
error if it exceeds the request limit for your access level within the last 24
hours.

## Test Account Access

After you've completed the initial sign-up for the Google Ads API, you're issued
a developer token with the Test Account Access level. This means that the
developer token can only make Google Ads API requests against test accounts.

### How to apply for Test Account Access

Complete the Google Ads API sign-up
on the Google Ads web interface to automatically be granted the Test Account
Access level.

## Basic Access

Basic Access level allows the developer token to make Google Ads API requests against
both test accounts and production accounts. Production accounts are any
accounts that serve real, live Google ads—test accounts don't serve ads.
Basic Access level allows the developer token to execute up to 15,000 operations
per day. This is sufficient for most developers.

### How to apply for Basic Access

If you have a developer token with Test Account Access level and you would
like to apply for production account access, fill out the Basic Access
application form.
Make sure you've completed these steps:
Ensure that you already have a developer token with Test Account Access
level.
Ensure that the API Contact Email in the API center is up-to-date. You
must be logged in to your manager account to see the API center. You
won't be able to complete the application process without a valid,
regularly checked email address. Ensure you have linked all of
your active Google Ads accounts to the manager account with the API token.

## Standard Access

Standard Access level allows the developer token to execute an unlimited number
of operations per day for most services. This includes but is not limited to
GoogleAdsService Search and
SearchStream. For more details
on limits and exceptions to Standard Access level, see
API quotas.
GoogleAdsService
SearchStream
The Standard Access level are only granted to developers who require
unlimited Google Ads API operations, such as large companies or tools that
serve many users.
Regardless of access level, all API operations are subject to system rate
limits. To learn more about how to handle rate limit errors, see
Error types.

### How to apply for Standard Access

If you have a developer token with Basic Access level and you would like to
apply for unlimited Google Ads API operations, fill out the Standard Access
application form.
If your tool is external, be prepared to provide demo sign-in access to
your tool. Note that your tool must comply with the Required Minimum
Functionality.

## Permissible use

Permissible use only applies to developer tokens with Basic Access and Standard
Access levels. Permissible use is allocated based on intended use of the
Google Ads API. These permissions determine which features of the API a developer token
can be used for, as elaborated in the following table:
Ad creation / management
Provide access to all services of the API for creating and managing
   Google Ads campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.
Only make GoogleAdsService.Search
    or GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
    requests, or read-only calls. This is for developers who only use the API to
    request stats.
GoogleAdsService.Search
GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
Researching keywords and recommendations
Allow the token to access RecommendationService, KeywordPlanIdeaService,
    and KeywordPlanService. This is only used by tools requiring suggestions to
    help facilitate the creation and management of Google Ads campaigns.

### How to change permissible use

If your developer token has been approved for either the Basic Access or
Standard Access level, you can fill out the application to update permissible
use. Fill out the
application if you would like to update your permissible use or grant your
clients access to your tool.

If your tool is external, be prepared to provide demo sign-in access to
your tool. Note that your tool must comply with the Required Minimum
Functionality.

## Permissible use

Permissible use only applies to developer tokens with Basic Access and Standard
Access levels. Permissible use is allocated based on intended use of the
Google Ads API. These permissions determine which features of the API a developer token
can be used for, as elaborated in the following table:
Ad creation / management
Provide access to all services of the API for creating and managing
   Google Ads campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.
Only make GoogleAdsService.Search
    or GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
    requests, or read-only calls. This is for developers who only use the API to
    request stats.
GoogleAdsService.Search
GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
Researching keywords and recommendations
Allow the token to access RecommendationService, KeywordPlanIdeaService,
    and KeywordPlanService. This is only used by tools requiring suggestions to
    help facilitate the creation and management of Google Ads campaigns.

### How to change permissible use

If your developer token has been approved for either the Basic Access or
Standard Access level, you can fill out the application to update permissible
use. Fill out the
application if you would like to update your permissible use or grant your
clients access to your tool.

# Obtain a developer token



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The developer token is a 22-character long alphanumeric string that lets
your app connect to the Google Ads API. After the token is assigned to you by Google,
you can view it or create a new one on the API Center page of your Google Ads
manager account.
Each developer token is assigned an access level which
controls the number of API calls you can make per day with the token, as well
as the environment to which you can make calls.
To make API calls against your production account, you must request
Basic Access level or Standard Access level for your developer token
during the token application process. Since these access levels are not required
to make calls against test accounts, you can proceed with the exercises, but
you're encouraged to check out how to apply for Basic
Access level after you've completed this guide.

## Do you need a new developer token?

Whether you should sign up for a new developer token or not depends on a few
factors. Here are some common scenarios:
Your company has never used the Google Ads API before and you want to develop
     your own apps
Sign up for a new developer token. Learn more
Your company is actively using or has used the Google Ads API in the past
Google usually grants one developer token per company, so if your company
      already uses the Google Ads API, then you should reuse your existing developer
      token. Learn more
Your company already uses the Google Ads API but is also developing a new
      product or tool
If you're certain that you cannot use your existing developer token, then
      you can apply for a new one explaining your use case in the application.
      For the rest of this guide, you can use your existing developer
      token. Learn more
Your company uses a third-party app
You need a developer token only if you're developing your own app. If you
      use a third-party app or service, then the developer of that app needs to
      get a developer token for the app. If you're unclear about your case,
      contact
      the API compliance team.

## How to apply for a developer token

There are two steps when applying for a developer token.

### Step 1: Select or create a Google Ads manager account

If you already have a Google Ads manager account, select it when applying for the
token. If this manager account is not already linked to your other accounts, we
recommend putting it at the root of your account hierarchy to ease the token
review process and simplify account management later on.
If you don't have a manager account, you can follow the Help Center
instructions to create one.

### Step 2: Apply for access to the Google Ads API

Google Ads API

# Access levels and RMF



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The Google Ads API has access levels associated with the developer
token, and uses an application review process to grant various access
levels. It's important to plan and obtain the correct access levels before
productionizing your application.
A common scenario is that your application development starts with
Basic Access, but then outgrows its quota limits over time. At that
point, you should apply for Standard Access. Since the review
process could take days or sometimes weeks to complete, request the Standard
Access upgrade well before you actually need the increased quota limits.
Google may require that your app provide certain capabilities or features as
listed in the Required Minimum Functionality (RMF). When using the
Google Ads API, the RMF only applies to developer tokens with Standard Access. Make
sure you review these requirements in advance to avoid additional delays around
building the necessary features in your app.
The Google Ads API is free to use; there are no charges for using the Google Ads API at either
the Basic Access, or Standard Access levels. However, if you are subject to
 Required Minimum Functionality (RMF), the API Review Team will audit
 your tool for compliance. If the audit results in a finding of
 non-compliance, you may be required to pay non-compliance fees.

# Test accounts



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Test accounts let you try out new API implementations or account configurations
prior to implementing the changes in your production environment.
While production accounts serve ads that require billing and are rendered to
users, test accounts appear in the Google Ads UI as cancelled accounts since there
is no active billing and they don't render ads to users.
Because test and production accounts cannot interact in any way, you cannot use
a test account under your existing production manager account. To use test
accounts, you need a new account hierarchy, with a test manager account as the
root.

## Why use test accounts?

Test accounts don't affect your live ads or charge your account, hence they're a
useful way to experiment with the API. Test accounts provide extra benefits
during active development. Particularly, test accounts:
Can be set up in a hierarchy and organized just like production accounts.
Can be viewed and manipulated in the Google Ads UI, just like production
accounts.
Don't require an approved developer token, so you can start experimenting
with the API immediately, even before your application is reviewed or
approved.
Can't serve ads or interact with your production accounts in any way. This
gives you a safe environment to test code or configuration changes without
impacting your serving accounts.
Have the same restrictions, including rate
limits, as production accounts.
Since test accounts don't have budgets, you might see an error when creating a
test sub-account in a manager account. You can safely ignore this error.

## Create test accounts and campaigns

The following instructions create a test manager account, a test client account,
and a few campaigns to populate the test client account. Note that "client" here
refers to a Google Ads client account, not your client app.
Click the blue button to create a test manager account. If prompted, sign
in with a Google Account that isn't
linked to your production
Google Ads manager account.
There is also a link to create a new Google Account if you need to do so.

## View test accounts

To view test accounts in the UI, you can
unhide the accounts by
choosing to view cancelled accounts.
Test accounts appear with a red label:
If you don't see the red Test account label on your Google Ads account page,
then the account is a production account.

## Limitations

Test accounts are a great option for testing changes before deploying them to
production, or developing your application while your developer token has
test account access. However, there are
some limitations to keep in mind.
Because test accounts can't serve ads or interact with your production
accounts in any way, serving metrics -- like impressions, conversions, or
cost data -- are empty.
Some features cannot be tested with test accounts. This includes bid
simulations, conversion uploads, and billing. Other features, including
recommendations, have limited capabilities within test accounts because
test accounts don't generate serving data.
Test manager account hierarchies can contain
up to 50 test accounts.
Test accounts generating a high volume of continuous requests may be
throttled without notice.
Take a look at the
Testing Best Practices
page for guidance on working around these limitations.

# Choose your application type



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Since Google Ads accounts contain user data, your application must obtain
authorization from the user to access this data. There are two broad approaches
based on how you obtain this authorization.

## Choose your app type

Since Google Ads accounts contain user data, your app needs to obtain
authorization from the user to access this data. There are two broad approaches
based on how you obtain this authorization.
Service Account
User Authentication
Manually configure your Google Ads account to give a service account access
    to that account. Afterwards, your app can use the service account
    credentials to make API calls to the Google Ads account without any user
    interaction. The API calls work as long as the service account has access
    to the Google Ads account.
Obtain a one-time OAuth 2.0 authorization from a user to
    allow your app to manage their Google Ads account. Afterwards, your
    app can use the OAuth 2.0 refresh token (issued as part of the OAuth 2.0
    authorization process) to make API calls to the Google Ads account. The API
    calls work as long as the user doesn't revoke the authorization, or until
    the authorization expires due to inactivity or other reasons.
Minimal configuration and approvals required due to lack of user
authorization in the app.
Extensive configuration and approvals required due to user authentication
being part of the app.
Strongly recommended as the preferred approach
Legacy approach. Use as a fallback option when you cannot give a service
account the required permissions to your Google Ads account.

This guide requires several prerequisite settings that were configured in
previous steps. Start with Introduction if
you haven't done so.

## Make an API call

Select your client of choice for instructions on how to make an API call:
The client library artifacts are published to the Maven central
repository. Add
the client library as a dependency to your project as follows:
The Maven dependency is:
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.api-ads</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-ads</artifactId>
  <version>39.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.api-ads</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-ads</artifactId>
  <version>39.0.0</version>
</dependency>
The Gradle dependency is:
implementation 'com.google.api-ads:google-ads:39.0.0'
implementation 'com.google.api-ads:google-ads:39.0.0'
api.googleads.serviceAccountSecretsPath=JSON_KEY_FILE_PATH
api.googleads.developerToken=INSERT_DEVELOPER_TOKEN_HERE
api.googleads.loginCustomerId=INSERT_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID_HERE
api.googleads.serviceAccountSecretsPath=JSON_KEY_FILE_PATH
api.googleads.developerToken=INSERT_DEVELOPER_TOKEN_HERE
api.googleads.loginCustomerId=INSERT_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID_HERE
Create a GoogleAdsClient object as follows:
GoogleAdsClient
GoogleAdsClient googleAdsClient = null;
try {
  googleAdsClient = GoogleAdsClient.newBuilder().fromPropertiesFile().build();
} catch (FileNotFoundException fnfe) {
  System.err.printf(
      "Failed to load GoogleAdsClient configuration from file. Exception: %s%n",
      fnfe);
  System.exit(1);
} catch (IOException ioe) {
  System.err.printf("Failed to create GoogleAdsClient. Exception: %s%n", ioe);
  System.exit(1);
}
GoogleAdsClient googleAdsClient = null;
try {
  googleAdsClient = GoogleAdsClient.newBuilder().fromPropertiesFile().build();
} catch (FileNotFoundException fnfe) {
  System.err.printf(
      "Failed to load GoogleAdsClient configuration from file. Exception: %s%n",
      fnfe);
  System.exit(1);
} catch (IOException ioe) {
  System.err.printf("Failed to create GoogleAdsClient. Exception: %s%n", ioe);
  System.exit(1);
}
Next, run a campaign report using the GoogleAdsService.SearchStream method to retrieve the
campaigns in your account. This guide doesn't cover the details of
reporting.
GoogleAdsService.SearchStream

The client library packages are published to the Nuget.org
repository. Start by adding
a nuget reference to Google.Ads.GoogleAds package.
Google.Ads.GoogleAds
dotnet add package Google.Ads.GoogleAds --version 18.1.0

## Configuration

Each Ads API Client library provides different configuration settings and
loading methods that you can use to customize its behavior.
Here are the environment variables that are common to all client libraries and
that can be loaded to set configuration settings:
Client library

GOOGLE_ADS_CONFIGURATION_FILE_PATH: Path to the configuration file.
GOOGLE_ADS_CONFIGURATION_FILE_PATH: Path to the configuration file.
GOOGLE_ADS_CONFIGURATION_FILE_PATH

Google Ads API

GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN : Set this to your developer token.
GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID : This is the customer ID of the authorized
customer to use in the request, without hyphens (-).
GOOGLE_ADS_LINKED_CUSTOMER_ID : This header is only required for methods
that update the resources of an entity when permissioned through
Linked Accounts in the Google Ads UI (AccountLink resource in the
Google Ads API). Set this value to the customer ID of the data provider that
updates the resources of the specified customer ID. It should be set
without hyphens (-). To learn more about Linked Accounts, visit the
Help Center.
GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN : Set this to your developer token.
GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN
GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID : This is the customer ID of the authorized
customer to use in the request, without hyphens (-).

Environment variables are commonly defined in a bash configuration file such
as a .bashrc or .bash_profile file located in the $HOME directory. They
can also be defined using the command line.
.bash_profile
Here are some basic steps to define an environment variable using a .bashrc
file using a terminal:
# Append the line "export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=1234567890" to
# the bottom of your .bashrc file.
echo "export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=1234567890" >> ~/.bashrc

# Update your bash environment to use the most recently updated
# version of your .bashrc file.
src ~/.bashrc
# Append the line "export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=1234567890" to
# the bottom of your .bashrc file.
echo "export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=1234567890" >> ~/.bashrc

# Update your bash environment to use the most recently updated
# version of your .bashrc file.
src ~/.bashrc
Environment variables can also be set in your terminal instance directly from
the command line:
export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=1234567890
export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=1234567890
Another alternative is to set environment variables when calling the command
that uses them:
GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=1234567890 php /path/to/script/that/uses/envvar.php
GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=1234567890 php /path/to/script/that/uses/envvar.php

## Fetch entities

GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
is typically used to fetch entities, and the results are returned as a stream
of rows. Alternatively, you can use
GoogleAdsService.Search to fetch
entities over an unreliable internet connection. GoogleAdsService.Search
returns results as fixed page sizes of 10,000 rows per page.
GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
GoogleAdsService.Search
GoogleAdsService.Search
Our client library automatically implements paging
when you iterate results so that you can sequentially download and process them
all at once.

Google Ads API

# Required Minimum Functionality



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Required Minimum Functionality (RMF) refers to the features and other
functionality that certain tool developers must offer when using the Google Ads API. As
set forth below, RMF rules are grouped into three categories: Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality, and Reporting Functionality. Your
compliance with these rules depends on how you use the Google Ads API (an "RMF applies"
means that RMF applies to you):
Full-Service Tool
      
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
RMF applies

Reporting Only
      
only a reporting dashboard available to end-advertisers
only a reporting dashboard available to end-advertisers
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
RMF applies
Internal Use Only
      
individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to
tool (meaning you're the only one that uses your tool)
individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to
tool (meaning you're the only one that uses your tool)
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
If your tool offers very limited and specialized functionality, and could not be
used for creating and managing campaigns, ad groups, and ads, it may not qualify
as a full-service tool. In this case, the creation and management RMF would not
apply. If you're not sure whether the RMF policy applies to your tool, contact
the Google Ads API Compliance team. The
Google Ads API Compliance team will decide whether your tool is full-service or not.
Your tool may be reevaluated if the functionality changes significantly.
Note that RMF only applies to developer tokens with Standard access.

## One-Time Extension for Major Updates

In recognition of the fact that API tools may periodically perform extensive
technology upgrades, tools that have met all RMF deadlines for at least 2
consecutive years can apply for a 6 month RMF extension in order to implement
such upgrades to their platform. If the extension is granted, during the
extension period these tools will not be reviewed for compliance with RMF
requirements. At the end of the extension period, the tool must be in full
compliance with all RMF requirements that were due on or before the last date of
the extension period. All RMF requirements due after the end of the extension
will remain due on the date specified in the table below.
An API tool may be granted at most one extension every four years (the
second extension must start at least 4 years after the first one ends).
If you would like to apply for an extension for your tool, request an
application form by contacting us at
https://support.google.com/adspolicy/contact/contact_ads_api. Your application must be
signed and submitted by an executive (CEO, CTO or Senior VP) of your company.
Note that your application is not guaranteed to be approved.

## Requirements for Shopping-only, App Promotion-only and Hotel-only API Tools

If your tool is only designed to create and manage one of the following
campaign types, then you are only required to implement the Google Ads API creation and
management features and reports in the RMF that work with that campaign type.
App Promotion campaign
Hotel campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Performance Max campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Smart campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Standard Shopping campaigns

## Requirements for Reporting-only Google Ads API Clients

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Reporting-only Google Ads API
Client must show Reporting Functionality for each of the levels of the Google
Ads hierarchy displayed in its reporting interface. A level of the Google Ads
hierarchy means one of Account, Campaign, Ad Group, Ad or Keyword. For example,
if a Reporting-only Google Ads Client does show Ad Groups, then it must implement
all of the "Ad Group"-level Reporting Functionality that is labeled as
"Required" below.
A Reporting-only Google Ads API Client may choose not to show specific levels of
the Google Ads hierarchy in its reporting interface. For example, if a
Reporting-only Google Ads API Client does not show any Ad Group performance data
in its interface, then it need not implement any of the "Ad Group"-level
Reporting RMF.
The above policy also applies to all other report types, though they are not
levels of the Google Ads hierarchy. Should you choose to implement any of these
reports, you must show all the required fields for each respective report.
In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, Google Ads API Client must display all
the columns marked required in the Object/Field/Guide column for each report, as
default. All other Metric columns must be made available,
as an option for users of the Google Ads API Client. Google Ads report data should be
reasonably prominent and accessible to end users.

## Downloadable Reports

If your tool provides a download option, for example a CSV, instead of
displaying reporting functionality within the user interface, then the download
link must be prominently displayed and intuitively labeled. The downloaded file
must contain all of the required reporting fields and be clearly labeled.

## Reporting Date Ranges

We recommend that you allow users to filter reporting data by date range. If
your tool doesn't support custom date ranges, then it should at least provide
the last 30 days of data for each required reporting field.

## Requirements for API Clients providing Creation Functionality or Management Functionality

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Full-Service Google Ads API Client
must implement all the required creation and management features in the table
below and show Reporting Functionality for each of the reports below.
Additionally, you must make reasonable effort to ensure that each of the
features is easily accessible and functional to end advertisers as measured by
the usage of those features.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Planning Services

If a Google Ads API Client provides any functionality related to KeywordPlanIdeaService
or KeywordPlanService, it must fully implement the required Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality and Reporting Functionality marked
"Required" in the table below.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Recommendation Service

All API clients are permitted to use GoogleAdsService and RecommendationService
to retrieve recommendations.
The use of RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation() and
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation() are limited to the following
types of Google Ads API Clients:
RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation()
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation()
Full-service tools
Internal-only tools
Shopping-only, Performance Max / Smart Shopping-only, App Promotion-only,
and Hotel-only API tools
Special purpose tools that offer campaign management functionality
If a Google Ads API Client offers the functionality to apply or dismiss recommendations
using RecommendationService, it must satisfy the following requirements:
It must fully implement the required Creation Functionality, Management
Functionality and Reporting Functionality for their tool category.
All Google Ads Recommendations shown to end users must be presented as
"Google Ads Recommendations" in the tool's UI.
End users must be able to view and apply all Google Ads Recommendations that
are surfaced by the Google Ads API Client.

## Requirements for Bid Adjustments

All API Clients providing Creation or Management functionality must satisfy the
following requirements related to bid adjustments:
End users must be allowed to input the entire range of allowable values.
End users must be able to review and edit the bid adjustments before it is
set by the Google Ads API Client.
Bid adjustments must be represented only as adjustments to bids, and may not
be used to enable or approximate other features, such as targeting or
exclusion.

## Feature Implementation

Unless otherwise specified below, a feature is implemented if and only if all
available sub-features and parameters are also implemented. The API
Reference documents which parameters and
sub-features are available. For example, the feature "Opt in/out of networks"
implies support for opting in/out of Google Search, search partners, and the
display network. Furthermore, if you implement in your Google Ads API Client a
feature similar to any feature not required by Google, you must then also
implement the similar Google feature in your Google Ads API Client. For example,
if you implement your own version of "Keyword Ideas" in your Google Ads API
Client, then you must also implement Google's "Keyword Ideas" functionality in
your Google Ads API Client.
To maintain RMF compliance, any new required features must be added by the due
date (shown next to each feature as Due: YYYY-MM-DD). Any RMFs with no
specified due date are past due. Additionally, we require that you send
screenshots and/or mockups of material proposed changes to the Google Ads API
Client, at least two weeks prior to these changes taking effect, using the Tool
Change form. For the sake of
clarity, after that two week period has elapsed, you do not need to wait for a
response from Google before those material changes take effect.

# Access Levels and Permissible Use



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Each Google Ads API developer token is assigned an access level and "permissible
use". The access level determines whether you can affect production accounts
and the number of operations and requests that you can execute daily.
Permissible use determines the specific Google Ads API features that the
developer token is allowed to use.

## Access levels

There are three different access levels listed in order in the table. If you
don't already have Google Ads API access, you can start by signing
up to obtain test account access.
You can increase the access level by completing some additional steps in the
application.
Test Account Access
Test accounts
15,000 operations / day
Instructions
Basic Access
Test and production accounts
15,000 operations / day
Instructions
Standard Access
Test and production accounts
Unlimited operations / day
Instructions
1 "Per day" is based on a sliding 24 hour time period in which API
requests were made with your developer token. Your application will receive an
error if it exceeds the request limit for your access level within the last 24
hours.

## Test Account Access

After you've completed the initial sign-up for the Google Ads API, you're issued
a developer token with the Test Account Access level. This means that the
developer token can only make Google Ads API requests against test accounts.

### How to apply for Test Account Access

Complete the Google Ads API sign-up
on the Google Ads web interface to automatically be granted the Test Account
Access level.

## Basic Access

Basic Access level allows the developer token to make Google Ads API requests against
both test accounts and production accounts. Production accounts are any
accounts that serve real, live Google ads—test accounts don't serve ads.
Basic Access level allows the developer token to execute up to 15,000 operations
per day. This is sufficient for most developers.

### How to apply for Basic Access

If you have a developer token with Test Account Access level and you would
like to apply for production account access, fill out the Basic Access
application form.
Make sure you've completed these steps:
Ensure that you already have a developer token with Test Account Access
level.
Ensure that the API Contact Email in the API center is up-to-date. You
must be logged in to your manager account to see the API center. You
won't be able to complete the application process without a valid,
regularly checked email address. Ensure you have linked all of
your active Google Ads accounts to the manager account with the API token.

## Standard Access

Standard Access level allows the developer token to execute an unlimited number
of operations per day for most services. This includes but is not limited to
GoogleAdsService Search and
SearchStream. For more details
on limits and exceptions to Standard Access level, see
API quotas.
GoogleAdsService
SearchStream
The Standard Access level are only granted to developers who require
unlimited Google Ads API operations, such as large companies or tools that
serve many users.
Regardless of access level, all API operations are subject to system rate
limits. To learn more about how to handle rate limit errors, see
Error types.

### How to apply for Standard Access

If you have a developer token with Basic Access level and you would like to
apply for unlimited Google Ads API operations, fill out the Standard Access
application form.
If your tool is external, be prepared to provide demo sign-in access to
your tool. Note that your tool must comply with the Required Minimum
Functionality.

## Permissible use

Permissible use only applies to developer tokens with Basic Access and Standard
Access levels. Permissible use is allocated based on intended use of the
Google Ads API. These permissions determine which features of the API a developer token
can be used for, as elaborated in the following table:
Ad creation / management
Provide access to all services of the API for creating and managing
   Google Ads campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.
Only make GoogleAdsService.Search
    or GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
    requests, or read-only calls. This is for developers who only use the API to
    request stats.
GoogleAdsService.Search
GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
Researching keywords and recommendations
Allow the token to access RecommendationService, KeywordPlanIdeaService,
    and KeywordPlanService. This is only used by tools requiring suggestions to
    help facilitate the creation and management of Google Ads campaigns.

### How to change permissible use

If your developer token has been approved for either the Basic Access or
Standard Access level, you can fill out the application to update permissible
use. Fill out the
application if you would like to update your permissible use or grant your
clients access to your tool.

Google Ads API

# API Limits and Quotas



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The Google Ads API enforces limits on API operations, such as the number of operations
that can be sent in a single mutate request. The following table summarizes
some of the important limits and quotas to be aware of.
Operations with Basic Access level
15,000 API operations per day
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
Mutate requests
10,000 operations per request
TOO_MANY_MUTATE_OPERATIONS
TOO_MANY_MUTATE_OPERATIONS
Planning Service requests
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
Conversion Upload Service requests
2,000 conversions per request
TOO_MANY_CONVERSIONS_IN_REQUEST
TOO_MANY_CONVERSIONS_IN_REQUEST
Billing and Account Budget Service requests
1 operation per mutate request
TOO_MANY_MUTATE_OPERATIONS
TOO_MANY_MUTATE_OPERATIONS

### Daily API operation limits

Daily API usage limits are based on the number of API
operations made per developer token. API
operations are the total sum of get requests and mutate operations. The limits
for daily API operations depends on the access level of the developer token. The
Access Levels and Permissible Use guide outlines the
specific API operation limits for each access level.
Requests that violate these limits are rejected with the error:
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED

### gRPC limitations

All of the Google Ads API client libraries use
gRPC for generating requests and responses. By default, gRPC has a
message size of 4 MB, but our client libraries set the max message size to
64 MB in order to increase efficiency.
Responses must not exceed this limit. For example, a search request that
includes a lot of fields may generate a response that exceeds 64 MB in size. To
avoid this limit, you can reduce the number of selected fields, or use
streaming. For mutates, send fewer operations
per request.
Requests that violate this limitation will not generate a
GoogleAdsError, but will generate a
429 Resource Exhausted gRPC error. Refer to the list of gRPC error codes and
messages.
GoogleAdsError
429 Resource Exhausted

### Mutate requests

In addition to counting against the user's daily operation quota, a mutate
request cannot contain more than 10,000 operations per request.
Requests that violate this limitation are rejected with the error:
TOO_MANY_MUTATE_OPERATIONS.
TOO_MANY_MUTATE_OPERATIONS
Additional limits and considerations for specific services and request types are
outlined next.

### Search requests

A Search or SearchStream request counts as one operation against the user's
daily operation quota. One SearchStream request counts as one API operation
irrespective of the number of batches.
SearchStream
SearchStream

### Paginated requests

Paginated requests (for example, requests that contain a valid
next_page_token) are not counted against a user's daily operation quota.
However, pagination requests that contain an expired or invalid page token will
generate an exception and will count against the daily operation quota.
next_page_token
For more details on pagination, refer to Paging through
results.

### Other types of requests

A request that is not a Get, Mutate, Search, or SearchStream request
counts as one operation against the user's daily operation quota.
SearchStream
A few examples of such requests include:
BatchJobService.ListMutateJobResults
BatchJobService.ListMutateJobResults
ConversionUploadService.UploadCallConversions
ConversionUploadService.UploadCallConversions
ConversionUploadService.UploadClickConversions
ConversionUploadService.UploadClickConversions
OfflineUserDataJobService.AddOfflineUserDataJobOperations
OfflineUserDataJobService.AddOfflineUserDataJobOperations
OfflineUserDataJobService.CreateOfflineUserDataJob
OfflineUserDataJobService.CreateOfflineUserDataJob
UserDataService.UploadUserData
UserDataService.UploadUserData

### Requests that return API exceptions

Requests that are rejected with a
GoogleAdsFailure still count against the
user's daily operation quota.
GoogleAdsFailure
Requests that fail but don't return a
GoogleAdsFailure, such as from an error at
the network level, won't count against the user's daily operation quota
since the requests would never reach the service. An example of this is a
network connectivity failure.
GoogleAdsFailure

### Keyword planning service

Due to cost and complexity, the following Keyword Planning service methods are
subject to separate limits from other types of requests.
Limited to 1 request per second per CID:

KeywordPlanIdeaService.GenerateKeywordIdeas
KeywordPlanIdeaService.GenerateKeywordHistoricalMetrics
KeywordPlanIdeaService.GenerateKeywordForecastMetrics

Requests that violate these limitations are rejected with the error:
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.

KeywordPlanIdeaService.GenerateKeywordHistoricalMetrics
KeywordPlanIdeaService.GenerateKeywordHistoricalMetrics
KeywordPlanIdeaService.GenerateKeywordForecastMetrics
KeywordPlanIdeaService.GenerateKeywordForecastMetrics
Requests that violate these limitations are rejected with the error:
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
1 QPS is calculated as 60 requests per 60 seconds.

### Invitations to customer accounts

New users can be invited to existing client accounts with the
CustomerUserAccessService. Because
this feature sends invitation emails to other users, it has the potential
to be misused, and thus there are limitations to its behavior:
CustomerUserAccessService
Users cannot receive more than one pending invitation for the same client
account. If a subsequent request is made to send an invitation to a user
that already has a pending invitation, this error is returned:
ACCESS_INVITATION_ERROR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_ALREADY_HAS_PENDING_INVITATION.
Users cannot receive more than one pending invitation for the same client
account. If a subsequent request is made to send an invitation to a user
that already has a pending invitation, this error is returned:
ACCESS_INVITATION_ERROR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_ALREADY_HAS_PENDING_INVITATION.
ACCESS_INVITATION_ERROR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_ALREADY_HAS_PENDING_INVITATION
Client accounts cannot have more than 70 invitations pending at one time.
If a request is sent that causes this value to be exceeded, this error is
returned:
ACCESS_INVITATION_ERROR_PENDING_INVITATIONS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED.
Client accounts cannot have more than 70 invitations pending at one time.
If a request is sent that causes this value to be exceeded, this error is
returned:
ACCESS_INVITATION_ERROR_PENDING_INVITATIONS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED.
ACCESS_INVITATION_ERROR_PENDING_INVITATIONS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
User data is managed with the
UserDataService and the
OfflineUserDataJobService.
In a given create or remove UserData operation, each
set of user_identifiers
should be specific to a single user.
UserDataService
OfflineUserDataJobService
user_identifiers
To enforce this,
an OfflineUserDataJobError.TOO_MANY_USER_IDENTIFIERS
or
UserDataError.TOO_MANY_USER_IDENTIFIERS
error is returned when there are more than 20 user_identifiers in a
UserData set.
OfflineUserDataJobError.TOO_MANY_USER_IDENTIFIERS
UserDataError.TOO_MANY_USER_IDENTIFIERS
user_identifiers
You are allowed up to 100,000 user identifiers regardless of the number of
 operations.

### Other types of limits

A repeated field, such as a list of operations, that has too many items in a
request can incur the error:
REQUEST_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED.
This same error message can also be due to other issues.
REQUEST_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
If you encounter this limitation and are making requests that use a repeated
field, try reducing the number of items in the repeated field by deploying a
list of operations in a mutate request.
When making a GAQL query, the maximum number of items
within an IN clause is 20,000. If you exceed that limit, a
FILTER_HAS_TOO_MANY_VALUES
error is returned.
FILTER_HAS_TOO_MANY_VALUES

--------------------------------------------------
Google Ads API

# Error Types



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

We've categorized errors into the following broad categories:
Authentication
Sync-related
Though these categories don't encompass all possible errors, and
some may fit into more than one category, they can nevertheless serve as
a starting point for structuring your app's error handling. See the following
resources for more details about specific errors:
Common Errors provides more details about a
particular error.
google.rpc.Status for
details about the logical error model used by the API.

## Authentication errors

Authentication refers to whether your app has been given permission by a user to
access Google Ads on their behalf. Authentication is managed through
credentials generated by the OAuth2 flow.
The most common reason an authentication error arises from factors beyond your
control is that the authenticated user has revoked the permission they gave your
app to act on their behalf. For example, if your app manages separate Google Ads
accounts for independent clients and authenticates separately as each client
when managing that client's account, a client could revoke your app's access at
any time. Depending on when your access was revoked, the API may directly return
an AuthenticationError.OAUTH_TOKEN_REVOKED error, or the built-in credential
objects in the Client Libraries may throw a
token revoked exception. In either case, if your app has a UI for your clients,
it could ask them to relaunch the OAuth2 flow to reestablish your app's
permission to act on their behalf.
AuthenticationError.OAUTH_TOKEN_REVOKED

## Retryable errors

Some errors, such as TRANSIENT_ERROR
 or INTERNAL_ERROR,
 can indicate a temporary problem that may be resolved by retrying the
 request after a short pause.
TRANSIENT_ERROR
INTERNAL_ERROR
For user-initiated requests, one strategy is to immediately indicate an error in
your UI and give the user an option to trigger a retry. Alternatively, your app
could first automatically retry the request, only exposing the error in the UI
after reaching a maximum number of retries or total user wait time.
For requests initiated on the back end, your app should automatically retry the
request up to a maximum number of retries.
When you retry requests, use an exponential backoff policy. For example, if you
first pause 5 seconds before the first retry, you could pause 10 seconds after
the second and 20 seconds after the third retry. Exponential backoff helps
ensure you are not calling the API too aggressively.

## Validation errors

Validation errors indicate that an input to an operation was not acceptable.
For example, PolicyViolationError,
 DateError,
 DateRangeError,
 StringLengthError, and
 UrlFieldError.
PolicyViolationError
DateRangeError
StringLengthError
UrlFieldError
Validation errors occur most commonly in user-initiated requests, where a user
has entered invalid input. In these cases, you should provide an appropriate
error message to the user based on the specific API error you received. You can
also validate user input for common mistakes before making an API call, making
your app more responsive and your API usage more efficient. For requests from
the back end, your app could add the failed operation to a queue
for a human operator to review.

## Sync-related errors

Many Google Ads apps maintain a local database to store their Google Ads objects. One
challenge to this approach is that the local database may go out of sync with
the actual objects in Google Ads. For example, a user might delete an ad group
directly in Google Ads, but the app and local database are unaware of the change and
continue to issue API calls as if the ad group existed. These sync issues can
manifest as a variety of errors such as DUPLICATE_CAMPAIGN_NAME,
DUPLICATE_ADGROUP_NAME,
AD_NOT_UNDER_ADGROUP,
CANNOT_OPERATE_ON_REMOVED_ADGROUPAD,
 and many others.
DUPLICATE_CAMPAIGN_NAME
DUPLICATE_ADGROUP_NAME
AD_NOT_UNDER_ADGROUP
CANNOT_OPERATE_ON_REMOVED_ADGROUPAD
For user-initiated requests, one strategy is to alert the user to a possible
sync problem, immediately launch a job that retrieves the relevant class of
Google Ads objects and updates the local database, then prompt the user to refresh
the UI.
For back-end requests, some errors provide enough information for your
app to automatically and incrementally correct your local database. For example,
CANNOT_OPERATE_ON_REMOVED_ADGROUPAD
 should cause your app to mark that ad as
removed in your local database. Errors that you cannot handle in this way could
cause your app to launch a more complete sync job or be added to a queue for a
human operator to review.
CANNOT_OPERATE_ON_REMOVED_ADGROUPAD

Google Ads API

# Access Levels and Permissible Use



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Each Google Ads API developer token is assigned an access level and "permissible
use". The access level determines whether you can affect production accounts
and the number of operations and requests that you can execute daily.
Permissible use determines the specific Google Ads API features that the
developer token is allowed to use.

## Access levels

There are three different access levels listed in order in the table. If you
don't already have Google Ads API access, you can start by signing
up to obtain test account access.
You can increase the access level by completing some additional steps in the
application.
Test Account Access
Test accounts
15,000 operations / day
Instructions
Basic Access
Test and production accounts
15,000 operations / day
Instructions
Standard Access
Test and production accounts
Unlimited operations / day
Instructions
1 "Per day" is based on a sliding 24 hour time period in which API
requests were made with your developer token. Your application will receive an
error if it exceeds the request limit for your access level within the last 24
hours.

## Test Account Access

After you've completed the initial sign-up for the Google Ads API, you're issued
a developer token with the Test Account Access level. This means that the
developer token can only make Google Ads API requests against test accounts.

### How to apply for Test Account Access

Complete the Google Ads API sign-up
on the Google Ads web interface to automatically be granted the Test Account
Access level.

## Basic Access

Basic Access level allows the developer token to make Google Ads API requests against
both test accounts and production accounts. Production accounts are any
accounts that serve real, live Google ads—test accounts don't serve ads.
Basic Access level allows the developer token to execute up to 15,000 operations
per day. This is sufficient for most developers.

### How to apply for Basic Access

If you have a developer token with Test Account Access level and you would
like to apply for production account access, fill out the Basic Access
application form.
Make sure you've completed these steps:
Ensure that you already have a developer token with Test Account Access
level.
Ensure that the API Contact Email in the API center is up-to-date. You
must be logged in to your manager account to see the API center. You
won't be able to complete the application process without a valid,
regularly checked email address. Ensure you have linked all of
your active Google Ads accounts to the manager account with the API token.

## Standard Access

Standard Access level allows the developer token to execute an unlimited number
of operations per day for most services. This includes but is not limited to
GoogleAdsService Search and
SearchStream. For more details
on limits and exceptions to Standard Access level, see
API quotas.
GoogleAdsService
SearchStream
The Standard Access level are only granted to developers who require
unlimited Google Ads API operations, such as large companies or tools that
serve many users.
Regardless of access level, all API operations are subject to system rate
limits. To learn more about how to handle rate limit errors, see
Error types.

### How to apply for Standard Access

If you have a developer token with Basic Access level and you would like to
apply for unlimited Google Ads API operations, fill out the Standard Access
application form.
If your tool is external, be prepared to provide demo sign-in access to
your tool. Note that your tool must comply with the Required Minimum
Functionality.

## Permissible use

Permissible use only applies to developer tokens with Basic Access and Standard
Access levels. Permissible use is allocated based on intended use of the
Google Ads API. These permissions determine which features of the API a developer token
can be used for, as elaborated in the following table:
Ad creation / management
Provide access to all services of the API for creating and managing
   Google Ads campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.
Only make GoogleAdsService.Search
    or GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
    requests, or read-only calls. This is for developers who only use the API to
    request stats.
GoogleAdsService.Search
GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
Researching keywords and recommendations
Allow the token to access RecommendationService, KeywordPlanIdeaService,
    and KeywordPlanService. This is only used by tools requiring suggestions to
    help facilitate the creation and management of Google Ads campaigns.

If your developer token has been approved for either the Basic Access or
Standard Access level, you can fill out the application to update permissible
use. Fill out the

## Non-compliance fees

If you are subject to Required Minimum Functionality, the API
Review Team will audit your tool to ensure compliance. If the audit results in a
finding of non-compliance, you will receive notice that the enforcement period
has begun according to the following schedule:
Notice of non-compliance
30-day "fix-it" period begins
30-day fix-it period ends
If you are fully compliant with RMF, you will not incur any fees
Notice of continued non-compliance + first bill for non-compliance fee
Non-compliance fees (details below) are due in 30 days
First bill for non-compliance fee is due
If you are fully compliant with RMF and you have paid your non-compliance
   fees in full, the enforcement period ends
Notice of continued non-compliance + second bill for non-compliance fee
Non-compliance fees (details below) are due in 30 days
Second bill for non-compliance fee is due
If you are fully compliant with RMF and you have paid your non-compliance
   fees in full, the enforcement period ends
Final notice of continued non-compliance + Final notice that tool may be
   downgraded to Basic Access level
Final deadline for compliance ends 30 days after Final notice
Final compliance deadline
Notice of Downgrade to Basic Access level
Tools may regain Standard Access level only if compliant with RMF and
   only if all non-compliance fees have been paid in full
Non-compliance fees are calculated as follows:
The fee is based on the number of operations, or the number of
GoogleAdsService Search or
SearchStream requests, during the previous 30-day period: either 1 USD
for every 25,000 operations or 1 USD for every 25,000
GoogleAdsService Search or
SearchStream requests, whichever is greater. The resulting calculation
is then rounded up to 1,000 USD, if below 1,000 USD, and capped at 25,000
USD. Total non-compliance fees during any review cycle is capped at
50,000 USD in accordance to the audit schedule above.

# Secure your credentials



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

This guide shows how to make sure your application and user credentials are
secure.

## Complete the OAuth App verification

The OAuth 2.0 scope for the Google Ads API is classified as a
restricted scope, which means that you should complete the OAuth
application verification process before productionizing your application. See
the Google Identity documentation and Help Center article to
learn more.

## Secure the application credentials

You should secure your application's OAuth 2.0 client ID, and client secret.
These credentials help your users and Google identify your application and thus
they should be handled carefully. You should treat these application credentials
like passwords. Don't share them using insecure mechanisms such as posting on
public forums, sending configuration files containing these credentials in email
attachments, hard coding the credentials, or committing them to a code
repository. We recommend using a secret manager such as Google Cloud Secret
manager or AWS Secret Manager when possible.
If your OAuth 2.0 client secrets are compromised, you can reset them. A
developer token can also be reset.

## Secure the developer token

The developer token lets you make API calls to an account, but has no
restrictions on which accounts it can be used with to make the calls. As a
result, a compromised developer token can be used by someone else to make calls
that are attributed to your application. To avoid this scenario, take these
preventive measures:
Treat your developer token like a password. Don't share it using insecure
mechanisms such as posting on public forums or sending configuration files
containing the developer tokens as an email attachment. We recommend using a
secret manager such as Google Cloud Secret manager or AWS Secret
Manager when possible.
Treat your developer token like a password. Don't share it using insecure
mechanisms such as posting on public forums or sending configuration files
containing the developer tokens as an email attachment. We recommend using a
secret manager such as Google Cloud Secret manager or AWS Secret
Manager when possible.
If your developer token is compromised, you should reset it.

Sign in to the Google Ads manager account that you used when applying for
Google Ads API.
Navigate to Tools & Settings > API Center.
Click the drop-down arrow next to Developer token.
Click the Reset token link. Your old developer token should stop
working immediately.
Update your application's production configuration to use the new
developer token.

Click the drop-down arrow next to Developer token.
Click the Reset token link. Your old developer token should stop
working immediately.
Update your application's production configuration to use the new
developer token.

## Secure the service accounts

Service accounts require domain-wide impersonation to work correctly with the
Google Ads API, In addition, you should be a Google Workspace customer to set up
domain-wide impersonation. For these reasons, we recommend against using service
accounts when making Google Ads API calls. However, if you decide to use service
accounts, you should secure them as follows:
Treat your service account key and JSON file as passwords. Secure them using
a secret manager such as Google Cloud Secret manager or AWS Secret
Manager when possible.
Treat your service account key and JSON file as passwords. Secure them using
a secret manager such as Google Cloud Secret manager or AWS Secret
Manager when possible.
Follow the additional best practices from Google Cloud to secure
and manage your service accounts.
Follow the additional best practices from Google Cloud to secure
and manage your service accounts.

## Secure the user tokens

If your app authorizes multiple users, you should take additional steps to
protect the users' refresh and access tokens. Store the tokens securely at
rest and never transmit them in plain text. Use a secure storage system
appropriate for your platform.

## Handle refresh token revocation and expiration

If your app requests OAuth 2.0 refresh token as part of authorization, you must
also handle their invalidation or expiration. Refresh tokens could be
invalidated for various reasons, and your application should respond
gracefully either by reauthorizing the user during their next login session, or
cleaning up their data as appropriate. Offline jobs, such as cron jobs, should
detect and record accounts whose refresh tokens have expired, instead of
continuing to make failed requests. Google might throttle applications that
generate high levels of errors over a sustained period of time to maintain the
stability of the API servers.

## Manage consent for multiple scopes

If your app requests authorization for multiple OAuth 2.0 scopes, the user might
not grant all the OAuth scopes you've requested. Your app should handle the
denial of scopes by disabling the relevant features. You can prompt the user
again only after they've clearly indicated an intent to use the specific feature
that requires the scope. Use incremental authorization to request
appropriate OAuth scopes in such cases.
If your app's basic features require multiple scopes, explain this requirement
to the user before prompting for consent.

# Logging



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Logging and monitoring work in tandem to help you understand and optimize
application performance, as well as to diagnose errors and system-related
issues. You should turn on summary logs for all API calls and
detailed logs for failed API calls so that you can supply the API
call logs when needing technical support.

## Client library logging

The Google Ads API client libraries come with built-in logging. For platform-specific
logging details, consult the logging documentation within your client library of
choice.
Logging docs for Java
Logging docs for .NET
Logging docs for PHP
Logging docs for Python
Logging docs for Ruby
Logging docs for Perl
The Google Ads API client libraries generate a detailed log and a summary
log for each API call. The detailed log contains all the details of
the API call, whereas the summary log contains minimal details of the API call.
An example of each type of log is shown, with the logs truncated and formatted
for readability.

## What if I don't use a client library?

If you don't use a client library, implement your own logging to capture the
details of the outgoing and incoming API calls. You should log at least the
value of the request-id response header, which can then be shared with the
technical support teams as required.

## Logging to the cloud

There are many tools you can use to capture logs and performance metrics for
your application. For example, you can use Google Cloud Logging to log
performance metrics to your Google Cloud Project. This makes it
possible to set up dashboards and alerting in Google Cloud Monitoring
to make use of the logged metrics.
Cloud Logging offers client libraries for all supported Google Ads API client
library languages except for Perl, so in most cases it is possible to log with
Cloud Logging directly from your client library integration. For other languages
including Perl, Cloud Logging also offers a REST API.
There are a few options for logging to Cloud Logging, or another tool, from a
Google Ads API client library. Each option comes with its own tradeoffs of time to
implement, complexity, and performance. Think carefully about these tradeoffs
before deciding which solution to implement.

### Option 1: Write local logs to the cloud from a background process

Client library logs can be written to a local file on your machine by modifying
your logging configuration. Once the logs are output to a local file, you can
set up a daemon to collect the logs and send them to the cloud.
One limitation of this approach is that some performance metrics won't be
captured by default. Client library logs include details from the request and
response objects, so latency metrics won't be included unless additional changes
are made to log these as well.

### Option 2: Run your application on Compute Engine and install the Ops Agent

If your application is running on Compute Engine, you can send your
logs to Google Cloud Logging by installing the Ops Agent. The Ops
Agent can be configured to send your application logs to Cloud
Logging, in addition to the metrics and logs that are sent by default.
If your application is already running in a Google Cloud environment, or if you
are considering moving your application to Google Cloud, this is a great option
to consider.

### Option 3: Implement logging in your application code

Logging directly from the application code can be done in one of two ways:
Incorporating metrics calculations and log statements in every
applicable location in your code. This option is more feasible for smaller
codebases, where the scope and maintenance costs of such a change would be
minimal.

applicable location in your code. This option is more feasible for smaller
codebases, where the scope and maintenance costs of such a change would be
minimal.
Implementing a logging interface. If the application logic can be abstracted
so that different pieces of the application inherit from the same base
class, logging logic can be implemented in that base class. This option is
generally preferred over incorporating log statements throughout the
application code, as it is easier to maintain and scale. For larger
codebases, the maintainability and scalability of this solution are all the
more relevant.

generally preferred over incorporating log statements throughout the
application code, as it is easier to maintain and scale. For larger
codebases, the maintainability and scalability of this solution are all the
more relevant.
One limitation of this approach is that the full request and response logs are
not available from the application code. Full request and response objects can
be accessed from gRPC interceptors; this is how the built-in client library
logging obtains request and response logs. In the event of an error, additional
information might be available in the exception object, but fewer details are
available for successful responses within the application logic. For example, in
most cases, the request ID for a successful request is not accessible from the
Google Ads API response objects.

### Option 4: Implement a custom gRPC logging interceptor

gRPC supports unary and streaming interceptors which can access the
request and response objects as they pass between the client and the server. The
Google Ads API client libraries use gRPC interceptors to offer built-in logging
support. Similarly, you can implement a custom gRPC interceptor to access the
request and response objects, extract information for logging and monitoring
purposes, and write that data to the location of your choice.
Unlike some of the other solutions presented here, implementing a custom gRPC
interceptor gives you flexibility to capture request and response objects on
every request, and implement additional logic to capture details of the request.
For example, you can calculate elapsed time of a request by implementing
performance timing logic within the custom interceptor itself, then log the
metric to Google Cloud Logging to make it available for latency monitoring
within Google Cloud Monitoring.

#### Custom Google Cloud Logging interceptor in Python

To demonstrate this solution, we have written an example of a custom logging
interceptor in Python. The custom interceptor is created and passed into the
service client. It then accesses the request and response objects that pass
through on every service method call, processes data from those objects, and
sends the data to Google Cloud Logging.
In addition to the data that comes from the request and response objects, the
example implements some additional logic to capture the elapsed time of the
request, and some other metadata that would be useful for monitoring purposes,
like whether or not the request was successful. For more information on how this
information can be useful, both generally for monitoring, and specifically when
combining Google Cloud Logging and Google Cloud Monitoring, see the Monitoring
guide.

Title: https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/best-practices/rate-limits
--------------------------------------------------
Google Ads API

## Rate Limits

The Google Ads API buckets requests for rate limiting by queries per second (QPS) per
client customer ID (CID) and developer token, meaning that metering is enforced
independently on both CIDs and developer tokens. The Google Ads API
uses a Token Bucket algorithm to meter requests and determine an
appropriate QPS limit, so the exact limit will vary depending on the overall
server load at any given time.
The purpose of imposing rate limits is to prevent one user from disrupting
service for other users by (either intentionally or unintentionally)
overwhelming the Google Ads API servers with a high volume of requests.
Requests that are in violation of rate limits will be rejected with the error:
RESOURCE_TEMPORARILY_EXHAUSTED.
RESOURCE_TEMPORARILY_EXHAUSTED
You can take control of your app and mitigate rate limits by both actively
reducing the number of requests and throttling QPS from the client side.
There are a number of ways to reduce the chances of exceeding the rate limit.
Becoming familiar with Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) concepts
such as Messaging, Redelivery, and Throttling can help you build a more robust
client app.
The following recommended practices ordered by complexity, with simpler
strategies at the top and more robust but sophisticated architectures after:
Limit concurrent tasks
Batching requests
Throttling and rate limiters

## Limit concurrent tasks

One root cause of exceeding rate limits is that the client app is spawning an
excessive number of parallel tasks. While we don't limit the number of parallel
requests a client app can have, this can easily exceed the Requests Per Second
limit at the developer token level.
Setting a reasonable upper bound for the total number of concurrent tasks that
are going to make requests (across all processes and machines), and adjusting
upward to optimize your throughput without exceeding the rate limit is
recommended.
Furthermore, you can consider throttling QPS from the client side (check out
Throttling and rate limiters).

## Batching requests

Consider batching multiple operations into a single request. This is most
applicable on MutateFoo calls. For example, if you're updating status for
multiple instances of AdGroupAd - instead of
calling MutateAdGroupAds
once for each AdGroupAd, you can call
MutateAdGroupAds once, and
pass in multiple operations. Refer to our batch operations guidance
for some additional examples.
MutateAdGroupAds
MutateAdGroupAds
While batching requests reduces the total number of requests and mitigates the
Requests Per Minute rate limit, it may trigger the Operations Per Minute rate
limit if you perform a large number of operations against a single account.

## Throttling and rate limiters

In addition to limiting the total number of threads in your client application,
you can also implement rate limiters on the client side. This can ensure all the
threads across your processes and / or clusters are governed by a specific QPS
limit from the client side.
You can check out Guava Rate Limiter, or implement your own Token
Bucket based algorithm for a clustered environment. For example, you
could generate tokens and store them in a shared transactional storage such as a
database, and each client would have to acquire and consume a token before it
processes the request. If the tokens were used up, the client would have to wait
until the next batch of tokens is generated.
A message queue is the solution for operation load distribution, while also
controlling request and consumer rates. There are a number of message queue
options available—some open source, some proprietary—and many of
them can work with different languages.
When using message queues, you can have multiple producers pushing messages to
the queue and multiple consumers processing those messages. Throttles can be
implemented at the consumer side by limiting the number of concurrent consumers,
or implement rate limiters or throttlers for either the producers or consumers.
For example, if a message consumer encounters a rates limit error, that consumer
can return the request to the queue to be retried. At the same time, that
consumer can also notify all other consumers to pause processing for a number of
seconds to recover from the error.

Google Ads API

# Access Levels and Permissible Use



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Each Google Ads API developer token is assigned an access level and "permissible
use". The access level determines whether you can affect production accounts
and the number of operations and requests that you can execute daily.
Permissible use determines the specific Google Ads API features that the
developer token is allowed to use.

## Access levels

There are three different access levels listed in order in the table. If you
don't already have Google Ads API access, you can start by signing
up to obtain test account access.
You can increase the access level by completing some additional steps in the
application.
Test Account Access
Test accounts
15,000 operations / day
Instructions
Basic Access
Test and production accounts
15,000 operations / day
Instructions
Standard Access
Test and production accounts
Unlimited operations / day
Instructions
1 "Per day" is based on a sliding 24 hour time period in which API
requests were made with your developer token. Your application will receive an
error if it exceeds the request limit for your access level within the last 24
hours.

## Test Account Access

After you've completed the initial sign-up for the Google Ads API, you're issued
a developer token with the Test Account Access level. This means that the
developer token can only make Google Ads API requests against test accounts.

### How to apply for Test Account Access

Complete the Google Ads API sign-up
on the Google Ads web interface to automatically be granted the Test Account
Access level.

## Basic Access

Basic Access level allows the developer token to make Google Ads API requests against
both test accounts and production accounts. Production accounts are any
accounts that serve real, live Google ads—test accounts don't serve ads.
Basic Access level allows the developer token to execute up to 15,000 operations
per day. This is sufficient for most developers.

### How to apply for Basic Access

If you have a developer token with Test Account Access level and you would
like to apply for production account access, fill out the Basic Access
application form.
Make sure you've completed these steps:
Ensure that you already have a developer token with Test Account Access
level.
Ensure that the API Contact Email in the API center is up-to-date. You
must be logged in to your manager account to see the API center. You
won't be able to complete the application process without a valid,
regularly checked email address. Ensure you have linked all of
your active Google Ads accounts to the manager account with the API token.

## Standard Access

Standard Access level allows the developer token to execute an unlimited number
of operations per day for most services. This includes but is not limited to
GoogleAdsService Search and
SearchStream. For more details
on limits and exceptions to Standard Access level, see
API quotas.
GoogleAdsService
SearchStream
The Standard Access level are only granted to developers who require
unlimited Google Ads API operations, such as large companies or tools that
serve many users.
Regardless of access level, all API operations are subject to system rate
limits. To learn more about how to handle rate limit errors, see
Error types.

### How to apply for Standard Access

If you have a developer token with Basic Access level and you would like to
apply for unlimited Google Ads API operations, fill out the Standard Access
application form.
If your tool is external, be prepared to provide demo sign-in access to
your tool. Note that your tool must comply with the Required Minimum
Functionality.

## Permissible use

Permissible use only applies to developer tokens with Basic Access and Standard
Access levels. Permissible use is allocated based on intended use of the
Google Ads API. These permissions determine which features of the API a developer token
can be used for, as elaborated in the following table:
Ad creation / management
Provide access to all services of the API for creating and managing
   Google Ads campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.
Only make GoogleAdsService.Search
    or GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
    requests, or read-only calls. This is for developers who only use the API to
    request stats.
GoogleAdsService.Search
GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
Researching keywords and recommendations
Allow the token to access RecommendationService, KeywordPlanIdeaService,
    and KeywordPlanService. This is only used by tools requiring suggestions to
    help facilitate the creation and management of Google Ads campaigns.

### How to change permissible use

If your developer token has been approved for either the Basic Access or
Standard Access level, you can fill out the application to update permissible
use. Fill out the
application if you would like to update your permissible use or grant your
clients access to your tool.

have not exceeded any of the above limits. This occurs when the internal

internal limits. Try reducing the size or complexity of the query. You may
need to execute more than one query to obtain your required result.

# Testing

Testing is an important step in building a successful Google Ads API integration,
whether you're just getting started, maintaining an app, or adding
new features to an existing integration. This guide presents some best
practices for testing your Google Ads API integration.

## Test accounts and production accounts

Test accounts are available for
development purposes. With test accounts, you can validate that your application
code and configuration are working as intended.
However, not all
features can be tested in a
test account account.
When test account limitations prevent you from testing some features in your
integration, you can instead use a production account for development.
Production accounts for development differ from test accounts in the following
ways:
Serve ads that can be seen by users
Require valid URLs
Must comply with
advertising policies
Because production accounts serve ads, they generate metrics letting you test
performance reports, as well as unlocking all the other features of the
Google Ads API. However, using them for development requires extra caution. We
recommend taking the following measures:
Only grant access to users that need it for development purposes.
Set a fixed, low daily account budget.
Use production accounts for development only when test accounts can't be
used.
Thus, to do full testing of your integration, you will likely need both test
credentials and production credentials.

## Test credentials

To minimize the risk of accidentally modifying production accounts when trying
to modify development accounts, we recommend maintaining a set of test
credentials that are separate from your production application credentials.
To create a set of test credentials:
Create an email account (e.g. api.test@example.com) or a service account
that will be used only for testing purposes.
Add this user or service account as a valid user in the Google Ads accounts you
are running your tests against. Make sure you give appropriate access levels
to this user or service account. Don't give this user or service account
access to any production accounts.
If you are using the OAuth 2.0 user authentication flow, rather than the
service account flow, then generate a refresh token for your test
user account.
Use these new credentials when testing your application. The developer token,
client ID, and client secret can be reused for testing purposes, since they
have no effect in determining which Google Ads accounts can be accessed.

## Request validation

If you just need to test whether a request is valid—for example, to
verify that the request is structured correctly and does not violate
policies—you can use the
validate_only
field, which is available for GoogleAdsService.SearchStream and
GoogleAdsService.Search requests, as well as most mutate requests.
Consult the reference documentation to verify
whether this field is available for a given method.
validate_only
GoogleAdsService.SearchStream
GoogleAdsService.Search
For ad hoc testing, for example to validate that a request yields the expected
output, using the REST API is often the easiest option. Consult the REST
examples to learn how to use curl in making
requests to the REST API. Also, try testing in the
REST explorer.

Title: Error Types



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
--------------------------------------------------
Google Ads API

# Error Types



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

We've categorized errors into the following broad categories:
Authentication
Sync-related
Though these categories don't encompass all possible errors, and
some may fit into more than one category, they can nevertheless serve as
a starting point for structuring your app's error handling. See the following
resources for more details about specific errors:
Common Errors provides more details about a
particular error.
google.rpc.Status for
details about the logical error model used by the API.

## Authentication errors

Authentication refers to whether your app has been given permission by a user to
access Google Ads on their behalf. Authentication is managed through
credentials generated by the OAuth2 flow.
The most common reason an authentication error arises from factors beyond your
control is that the authenticated user has revoked the permission they gave your
app to act on their behalf. For example, if your app manages separate Google Ads
accounts for independent clients and authenticates separately as each client
when managing that client's account, a client could revoke your app's access at
any time. Depending on when your access was revoked, the API may directly return
an AuthenticationError.OAUTH_TOKEN_REVOKED error, or the built-in credential
objects in the Client Libraries may throw a
token revoked exception. In either case, if your app has a UI for your clients,
it could ask them to relaunch the OAuth2 flow to reestablish your app's
permission to act on their behalf.
AuthenticationError.OAUTH_TOKEN_REVOKED

## Retryable errors

Some errors, such as TRANSIENT_ERROR
 or INTERNAL_ERROR,
 can indicate a temporary problem that may be resolved by retrying the
 request after a short pause.
TRANSIENT_ERROR
INTERNAL_ERROR
For user-initiated requests, one strategy is to immediately indicate an error in
your UI and give the user an option to trigger a retry. Alternatively, your app
could first automatically retry the request, only exposing the error in the UI
after reaching a maximum number of retries or total user wait time.
For requests initiated on the back end, your app should automatically retry the
request up to a maximum number of retries.
When you retry requests, use an exponential backoff policy. For example, if you
first pause 5 seconds before the first retry, you could pause 10 seconds after
the second and 20 seconds after the third retry. Exponential backoff helps
ensure you are not calling the API too aggressively.

## Validation errors

Validation errors indicate that an input to an operation was not acceptable.
For example, PolicyViolationError,
 DateError,
 DateRangeError,
 StringLengthError, and
 UrlFieldError.
PolicyViolationError
DateRangeError
StringLengthError
UrlFieldError
Validation errors occur most commonly in user-initiated requests, where a user
has entered invalid input. In these cases, you should provide an appropriate
error message to the user based on the specific API error you received. You can
also validate user input for common mistakes before making an API call, making
your app more responsive and your API usage more efficient. For requests from
the back end, your app could add the failed operation to a queue
for a human operator to review.

## Sync-related errors

Many Google Ads apps maintain a local database to store their Google Ads objects. One
challenge to this approach is that the local database may go out of sync with
the actual objects in Google Ads. For example, a user might delete an ad group
directly in Google Ads, but the app and local database are unaware of the change and
continue to issue API calls as if the ad group existed. These sync issues can
manifest as a variety of errors such as DUPLICATE_CAMPAIGN_NAME,
DUPLICATE_ADGROUP_NAME,
AD_NOT_UNDER_ADGROUP,
CANNOT_OPERATE_ON_REMOVED_ADGROUPAD,
 and many others.
DUPLICATE_CAMPAIGN_NAME
DUPLICATE_ADGROUP_NAME
AD_NOT_UNDER_ADGROUP
CANNOT_OPERATE_ON_REMOVED_ADGROUPAD
For user-initiated requests, one strategy is to alert the user to a possible
sync problem, immediately launch a job that retrieves the relevant class of
Google Ads objects and updates the local database, then prompt the user to refresh
the UI.
For back-end requests, some errors provide enough information for your
app to automatically and incrementally correct your local database. For example,
CANNOT_OPERATE_ON_REMOVED_ADGROUPAD
 should cause your app to mark that ad as
removed in your local database. Errors that you cannot handle in this way could
cause your app to launch a more complete sync job or be added to a queue for a
human operator to review.
CANNOT_OPERATE_ON_REMOVED_ADGROUPAD

# The .NET Client Library



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The .NET client library is hosted on GitHub and is distributed
as a NuGet package. It
offers several features to help you use the API, including easier management
of credentials and creation of Google Ads API service clients.
The library supports the following .NET Frameworks:
.NET Framework 4.7.2+ (net472)
.NET Standard 2.1 (netstandard2.1)
netstandard2.1
.NET 6.0 (net6.0)
.NET 8.0 (net8.0)
.NET Standard 2.1 is compatible with several other .NET versions and
implementations, so the library might work fine on many other platforms.
However, we haven't officially tested the compatibility and thus don't
officially support these platforms.
See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-2-1
to learn more about .NET standard compatibility.
The Google Ads API .NET library uses Grpc.Net.Client as the default, with a
fallback to Grpc.Core on unsupported platforms. You can force the use of
Grpc.Core by setting UseGrpcCore to true. See
Use the legacy Grpc library.
Grpc.Net.Client
UseGrpcCore
To start using this library, check the
prerequisites and consult the
getting started guide.
For information on OAuth2 refresh tokens, check out OAuth desktop and web
application flows. And to make API calls
using OAuth2 service accounts, see OAuth service account
flow.

# Overview



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The Python client library is hosted on GitHub,
and the package is available on PyPI.

### Requirements

The library requires Python 3.8 or later.

### Prerequisites

Before installing the library, you will need a developer token and
client customer ID. Instructions on how to obtain them are outlined in the
prerequisites section.
Note that you will generate the other required OAuth2 tokens in later steps.

### Runtime and dependency compatibility

The Python client library maintains compatibility with the Python runtimes in
the
Supported Versions
section published by the
Python Software Foundation, except for
versions with a status of "feature" or "prerelease".
When adopting new versions of the Python runtime, we aim to release a new
version of the Python client library that is compatible with the latest runtime
by the end of the quarter following its release. For example, if a new runtime
is released in October, a compatible version of the Python client library will
be available by the end of March in the following year.
Python runtimes that have reached End of Life (EOL) are not supported past the
End of Life date in the
Unsupported Versions section of
python.org.
We may release a version of the Python client library that is incompatible with
unsupported Python runtimes at any point after they reach EOL.
For dependencies, (specifically, any Google-maintained packages that are
listed as required
by the Python client library), we will maintain compatibility with packages that
are Google-maintained, and considered "supported" according to Google's
OSS Breaking Change Policy.
For a complete list of supported Python runtimes and dependencies, see the
Dependencies page.

### Installation

Follow the instructions in our installation
documentation to install the library from PyPi and return to this page.

### Configuration

Once you have installed the library you will need to set up a configuration for
it. There are multiple ways to configure the library, which are described in our
configuration documentation.

### Authentication

Once you've chosen a configuration type you can proceed with generating the
remaining OAuth2 tokens needed to make requests to the API. There are multiple
supported OAuth2 flows, which are documented in the list below. For details on
the differences between the flows and help deciding which is best for your
application, see our OAuth documentation.
OAuth desktop and web application flows
OAuth service account flow

### Making an API request

Once you've incorporated your OAuth2 tokens into your configuration, you're
ready to make an API request. Refer to the
get campaigns example for
a simple way to test that the library is properly configured to make API
requests.
To run the get_campaigns.py sample, in the root directory of your locally
installed googleads-python client library, run the following command:
get_campaigns.py
googleads-python
$ python examples/basic_operations/get_campaigns.py -c \
  INSERT_YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID_HERE
$ python examples/basic_operations/get_campaigns.py -c \
  INSERT_YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID_HERE

### Additional resources

After you're able to make an API request, proceed to these uses of the client
library:

The Perl client library is hosted on GitHub, and the package is
available on CPAN.
The library supports Perl version 5.28.1 or greater. To use this library, first
complete the prerequisites.

## REST API protocol

Class entities—such as service, resource, enum, and error—in the
Perl client library are generated by parsing the protocol buffer
definitions.
To learn more about how structured data is serialized, refer to the protocol
buffer documentation.
To connect with the Google Ads API, the client library creates an HTTP request in
JSON, sends it to the REST endpoint over HTTP
1.1, deserializes the response as a JSON object, and interprets the results.
See Getting
started and Basic
usage to start using this
library.
To get OAuth2 refresh tokens, refer to the following guides:
OAuth desktop application flow
OAuth web application flow
To make API calls using OAuth2 service accounts, see the OAuth service
account flow guide.

# Paging through results



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

GoogleAdsService.Search supports
paging in fixed page sizes of 10,000 rows. The result set of the query is split
into multiple responses, each of which 10,000 objects.
GoogleAdsService.Search
As an example, consider the following query:
SELECT
  ad_group.id,
  ad_group_criterion.type,
  ad_group_criterion.criterion_id,
  ad_group_criterion.keyword.text,
  ad_group_criterion.keyword.match_type
FROM ad_group_criterion
WHERE ad_group_criterion.type = KEYWORD
SELECT
  ad_group.id,
  ad_group_criterion.type,
  ad_group_criterion.criterion_id,
  ad_group_criterion.keyword.text,
  ad_group_criterion.keyword.match_type
FROM ad_group_criterion
WHERE ad_group_criterion.type = KEYWORD
If your account contains 50,000 keywords, the result set will contain 10,000
GoogleAdsRow objects in the first response,
along with a
next_page_token.
GoogleAdsRow
next_page_token
To retrieve the next 10,000 rows, send the request again, but update the
request's page_token to the response's
next_page_token.
Note that
next_page_token
is not populated in the response that contains the last batch of rows.
next_page_token
next_page_token
Our client libraries handle paging automatically. You only have to iterate
through the rows of the response. When all rows in the current page have
been returned, the client library fetches a new page of rows automatically on
your behalf until the entire dataset is retrieved. If using REST instead
of gRPC, you must explicitly make a request for each new page.
The Google Ads API internally caches the entire dataset, so subsequent requests are
faster than the initial one.
Your query must remain exactly the same in subsequent requests to take advantage
of the cached data. The requests won't contribute towards your quota,
particularly for Basic Access level. If
the query differs and is sent along with the same page token, an error is
returned.

# Required Minimum Functionality



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Required Minimum Functionality (RMF) refers to the features and other
functionality that certain tool developers must offer when using the Google Ads API. As
set forth below, RMF rules are grouped into three categories: Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality, and Reporting Functionality. Your
compliance with these rules depends on how you use the Google Ads API (an "RMF applies"
means that RMF applies to you):
Full-Service Tool
      
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts

RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
If your tool offers very limited and specialized functionality, and could not be
used for creating and managing campaigns, ad groups, and ads, it may not qualify
as a full-service tool. In this case, the creation and management RMF would not
apply. If you're not sure whether the RMF policy applies to your tool, contact
the Google Ads API Compliance team. The
Google Ads API Compliance team will decide whether your tool is full-service or not.
Your tool may be reevaluated if the functionality changes significantly.
Note that RMF only applies to developer tokens with Standard access.

## One-Time Extension for Major Updates

In recognition of the fact that API tools may periodically perform extensive
technology upgrades, tools that have met all RMF deadlines for at least 2
consecutive years can apply for a 6 month RMF extension in order to implement
such upgrades to their platform. If the extension is granted, during the
extension period these tools will not be reviewed for compliance with RMF
requirements. At the end of the extension period, the tool must be in full
compliance with all RMF requirements that were due on or before the last date of
the extension period. All RMF requirements due after the end of the extension
will remain due on the date specified in the table below.
An API tool may be granted at most one extension every four years (the
second extension must start at least 4 years after the first one ends).
If you would like to apply for an extension for your tool, request an
application form by contacting us at
https://support.google.com/adspolicy/contact/contact_ads_api. Your application must be
signed and submitted by an executive (CEO, CTO or Senior VP) of your company.
Note that your application is not guaranteed to be approved.

## Requirements for Shopping-only, App Promotion-only and Hotel-only API Tools

If your tool is only designed to create and manage one of the following
campaign types, then you are only required to implement the Google Ads API creation and
management features and reports in the RMF that work with that campaign type.
App Promotion campaign

## Requirements for Reporting-only Google Ads API Clients

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Reporting-only Google Ads API
Client must show Reporting Functionality for each of the levels of the Google
Ads hierarchy displayed in its reporting interface. A level of the Google Ads
hierarchy means one of Account, Campaign, Ad Group, Ad or Keyword. For example,
if a Reporting-only Google Ads Client does show Ad Groups, then it must implement
all of the "Ad Group"-level Reporting Functionality that is labeled as
"Required" below.
A Reporting-only Google Ads API Client may choose not to show specific levels of
the Google Ads hierarchy in its reporting interface. For example, if a
Reporting-only Google Ads API Client does not show any Ad Group performance data
in its interface, then it need not implement any of the "Ad Group"-level
Reporting RMF.
The above policy also applies to all other report types, though they are not
levels of the Google Ads hierarchy. Should you choose to implement any of these
reports, you must show all the required fields for each respective report.
In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, Google Ads API Client must display all
the columns marked required in the Object/Field/Guide column for each report, as
default. All other Metric columns must be made available,
as an option for users of the Google Ads API Client. Google Ads report data should be
reasonably prominent and accessible to end users.

## Downloadable Reports

If your tool provides a download option, for example a CSV, instead of
displaying reporting functionality within the user interface, then the download
link must be prominently displayed and intuitively labeled. The downloaded file
must contain all of the required reporting fields and be clearly labeled.

## Reporting Date Ranges

We recommend that you allow users to filter reporting data by date range. If
your tool doesn't support custom date ranges, then it should at least provide
the last 30 days of data for each required reporting field.

## Requirements for API Clients providing Creation Functionality or Management Functionality

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Full-Service Google Ads API Client
must implement all the required creation and management features in the table
below and show Reporting Functionality for each of the reports below.
Additionally, you must make reasonable effort to ensure that each of the
features is easily accessible and functional to end advertisers as measured by
the usage of those features.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Planning Services

If a Google Ads API Client provides any functionality related to KeywordPlanIdeaService
or KeywordPlanService, it must fully implement the required Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality and Reporting Functionality marked
"Required" in the table below.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Recommendation Service

All API clients are permitted to use GoogleAdsService and RecommendationService
to retrieve recommendations.
The use of RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation() and
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation() are limited to the following
types of Google Ads API Clients:
RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation()
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation()
Full-service tools
Internal-only tools
Shopping-only, Performance Max / Smart Shopping-only, App Promotion-only,
and Hotel-only API tools
Special purpose tools that offer campaign management functionality
If a Google Ads API Client offers the functionality to apply or dismiss recommendations
using RecommendationService, it must satisfy the following requirements:
It must fully implement the required Creation Functionality, Management
Functionality and Reporting Functionality for their tool category.
All Google Ads Recommendations shown to end users must be presented as
"Google Ads Recommendations" in the tool's UI.
End users must be able to view and apply all Google Ads Recommendations that
are surfaced by the Google Ads API Client.

## Requirements for Bid Adjustments

All API Clients providing Creation or Management functionality must satisfy the
following requirements related to bid adjustments:
End users must be allowed to input the entire range of allowable values.
End users must be able to review and edit the bid adjustments before it is
set by the Google Ads API Client.
Bid adjustments must be represented only as adjustments to bids, and may not
be used to enable or approximate other features, such as targeting or
exclusion.

## Feature Implementation

Unless otherwise specified below, a feature is implemented if and only if all
available sub-features and parameters are also implemented. The API
Reference documents which parameters and
sub-features are available. For example, the feature "Opt in/out of networks"
implies support for opting in/out of Google Search, search partners, and the
display network. Furthermore, if you implement in your Google Ads API Client a
feature similar to any feature not required by Google, you must then also
implement the similar Google feature in your Google Ads API Client. For example,
if you implement your own version of "Keyword Ideas" in your Google Ads API
Client, then you must also implement Google's "Keyword Ideas" functionality in
your Google Ads API Client.
To maintain RMF compliance, any new required features must be added by the due
date (shown next to each feature as Due: YYYY-MM-DD). Any RMFs with no
specified due date are past due. Additionally, we require that you send
screenshots and/or mockups of material proposed changes to the Google Ads API
Client, at least two weeks prior to these changes taking effect, using the Tool
Change form. For the sake of
clarity, after that two week period has elapsed, you do not need to wait for a
response from Google before those material changes take effect.

Google Ads API

# Required Minimum Functionality



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Required Minimum Functionality (RMF) refers to the features and other
functionality that certain tool developers must offer when using the Google Ads API. As
set forth below, RMF rules are grouped into three categories: Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality, and Reporting Functionality. Your
compliance with these rules depends on how you use the Google Ads API (an "RMF applies"
means that RMF applies to you):
Full-Service Tool
      
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts

Reporting Only
      
only a reporting dashboard available to end-advertisers

RMF doesn't apply

Internal Use Only
      
individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to

individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to
tool (meaning you're the only one that uses your tool)
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
If your tool offers very limited and specialized functionality, and could not be
used for creating and managing campaigns, ad groups, and ads, it may not qualify
as a full-service tool. In this case, the creation and management RMF would not
apply. If you're not sure whether the RMF policy applies to your tool, contact
the Google Ads API Compliance team. The
Google Ads API Compliance team will decide whether your tool is full-service or not.
Your tool may be reevaluated if the functionality changes significantly.
Note that RMF only applies to developer tokens with Standard access.

## One-Time Extension for Major Updates

In recognition of the fact that API tools may periodically perform extensive
technology upgrades, tools that have met all RMF deadlines for at least 2
consecutive years can apply for a 6 month RMF extension in order to implement
such upgrades to their platform. If the extension is granted, during the
extension period these tools will not be reviewed for compliance with RMF
requirements. At the end of the extension period, the tool must be in full
compliance with all RMF requirements that were due on or before the last date of
the extension period. All RMF requirements due after the end of the extension
will remain due on the date specified in the table below.
An API tool may be granted at most one extension every four years (the
second extension must start at least 4 years after the first one ends).
If you would like to apply for an extension for your tool, request an
application form by contacting us at
https://support.google.com/adspolicy/contact/contact_ads_api. Your application must be
signed and submitted by an executive (CEO, CTO or Senior VP) of your company.
Note that your application is not guaranteed to be approved.

## Requirements for Shopping-only, App Promotion-only and Hotel-only API Tools

If your tool is only designed to create and manage one of the following
campaign types, then you are only required to implement the Google Ads API creation and
management features and reports in the RMF that work with that campaign type.
App Promotion campaign
Hotel campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Performance Max campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Smart campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Standard Shopping campaigns

## Requirements for Reporting-only Google Ads API Clients

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Reporting-only Google Ads API
Client must show Reporting Functionality for each of the levels of the Google
Ads hierarchy displayed in its reporting interface. A level of the Google Ads
hierarchy means one of Account, Campaign, Ad Group, Ad or Keyword. For example,
if a Reporting-only Google Ads Client does show Ad Groups, then it must implement
all of the "Ad Group"-level Reporting Functionality that is labeled as
"Required" below.
A Reporting-only Google Ads API Client may choose not to show specific levels of
the Google Ads hierarchy in its reporting interface. For example, if a
Reporting-only Google Ads API Client does not show any Ad Group performance data
in its interface, then it need not implement any of the "Ad Group"-level
Reporting RMF.
The above policy also applies to all other report types, though they are not
levels of the Google Ads hierarchy. Should you choose to implement any of these
reports, you must show all the required fields for each respective report.
In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, Google Ads API Client must display all
the columns marked required in the Object/Field/Guide column for each report, as
default. All other Metric columns must be made available,
as an option for users of the Google Ads API Client. Google Ads report data should be
reasonably prominent and accessible to end users.

## Downloadable Reports

If your tool provides a download option, for example a CSV, instead of
displaying reporting functionality within the user interface, then the download
link must be prominently displayed and intuitively labeled. The downloaded file
must contain all of the required reporting fields and be clearly labeled.

## Reporting Date Ranges

We recommend that you allow users to filter reporting data by date range. If
your tool doesn't support custom date ranges, then it should at least provide
the last 30 days of data for each required reporting field.

## Requirements for API Clients providing Creation Functionality or Management Functionality

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Full-Service Google Ads API Client
must implement all the required creation and management features in the table
below and show Reporting Functionality for each of the reports below.
Additionally, you must make reasonable effort to ensure that each of the
features is easily accessible and functional to end advertisers as measured by
the usage of those features.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Planning Services

If a Google Ads API Client provides any functionality related to KeywordPlanIdeaService
or KeywordPlanService, it must fully implement the required Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality and Reporting Functionality marked
"Required" in the table below.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Recommendation Service

All API clients are permitted to use GoogleAdsService and RecommendationService
to retrieve recommendations.
The use of RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation() and
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation() are limited to the following
types of Google Ads API Clients:
RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation()
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation()
Full-service tools
Internal-only tools
Shopping-only, Performance Max / Smart Shopping-only, App Promotion-only,
and Hotel-only API tools
Special purpose tools that offer campaign management functionality
If a Google Ads API Client offers the functionality to apply or dismiss recommendations
using RecommendationService, it must satisfy the following requirements:
It must fully implement the required Creation Functionality, Management
Functionality and Reporting Functionality for their tool category.
All Google Ads Recommendations shown to end users must be presented as
"Google Ads Recommendations" in the tool's UI.
End users must be able to view and apply all Google Ads Recommendations that
are surfaced by the Google Ads API Client.

## Requirements for Bid Adjustments

All API Clients providing Creation or Management functionality must satisfy the
following requirements related to bid adjustments:
End users must be allowed to input the entire range of allowable values.
End users must be able to review and edit the bid adjustments before it is
set by the Google Ads API Client.
Bid adjustments must be represented only as adjustments to bids, and may not
be used to enable or approximate other features, such as targeting or
exclusion.

## Feature Implementation

Unless otherwise specified below, a feature is implemented if and only if all
available sub-features and parameters are also implemented. The API
Reference documents which parameters and
sub-features are available. For example, the feature "Opt in/out of networks"
implies support for opting in/out of Google Search, search partners, and the
display network. Furthermore, if you implement in your Google Ads API Client a
feature similar to any feature not required by Google, you must then also
implement the similar Google feature in your Google Ads API Client. For example,
if you implement your own version of "Keyword Ideas" in your Google Ads API
Client, then you must also implement Google's "Keyword Ideas" functionality in
your Google Ads API Client.
To maintain RMF compliance, any new required features must be added by the due
date (shown next to each feature as Due: YYYY-MM-DD). Any RMFs with no
specified due date are past due. Additionally, we require that you send
screenshots and/or mockups of material proposed changes to the Google Ads API
Client, at least two weeks prior to these changes taking effect, using the Tool
Change form. For the sake of
clarity, after that two week period has elapsed, you do not need to wait for a
response from Google before those material changes take effect.

Google Ads API

# Required Minimum Functionality



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Required Minimum Functionality (RMF) refers to the features and other
functionality that certain tool developers must offer when using the Google Ads API. As
set forth below, RMF rules are grouped into three categories: Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality, and Reporting Functionality. Your
compliance with these rules depends on how you use the Google Ads API (an "RMF applies"
means that RMF applies to you):
Full-Service Tool
      
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
RMF applies

Reporting Only
      
only a reporting dashboard available to end-advertisers
only a reporting dashboard available to end-advertisers
RMF doesn't apply

Internal Use Only
      
individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to
tool (meaning you're the only one that uses your tool)
individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to
tool (meaning you're the only one that uses your tool)
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
If your tool offers very limited and specialized functionality, and could not be
used for creating and managing campaigns, ad groups, and ads, it may not qualify
as a full-service tool. In this case, the creation and management RMF would not
apply. If you're not sure whether the RMF policy applies to your tool, contact
the Google Ads API Compliance team. The
Google Ads API Compliance team will decide whether your tool is full-service or not.
Your tool may be reevaluated if the functionality changes significantly.
Note that RMF only applies to developer tokens with Standard access.

## One-Time Extension for Major Updates

In recognition of the fact that API tools may periodically perform extensive
technology upgrades, tools that have met all RMF deadlines for at least 2
consecutive years can apply for a 6 month RMF extension in order to implement
such upgrades to their platform. If the extension is granted, during the
extension period these tools will not be reviewed for compliance with RMF
requirements. At the end of the extension period, the tool must be in full
compliance with all RMF requirements that were due on or before the last date of
the extension period. All RMF requirements due after the end of the extension
will remain due on the date specified in the table below.
An API tool may be granted at most one extension every four years (the
second extension must start at least 4 years after the first one ends).
If you would like to apply for an extension for your tool, request an
application form by contacting us at
https://support.google.com/adspolicy/contact/contact_ads_api. Your application must be
signed and submitted by an executive (CEO, CTO or Senior VP) of your company.
Note that your application is not guaranteed to be approved.

## Requirements for Shopping-only, App Promotion-only and Hotel-only API Tools

If your tool is only designed to create and manage one of the following
campaign types, then you are only required to implement the Google Ads API creation and
management features and reports in the RMF that work with that campaign type.
App Promotion campaign
Hotel campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Performance Max campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Smart campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Standard Shopping campaigns

## Requirements for Reporting-only Google Ads API Clients

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Reporting-only Google Ads API
Client must show Reporting Functionality for each of the levels of the Google
Ads hierarchy displayed in its reporting interface. A level of the Google Ads
hierarchy means one of Account, Campaign, Ad Group, Ad or Keyword. For example,
if a Reporting-only Google Ads Client does show Ad Groups, then it must implement
all of the "Ad Group"-level Reporting Functionality that is labeled as
"Required" below.
A Reporting-only Google Ads API Client may choose not to show specific levels of
the Google Ads hierarchy in its reporting interface. For example, if a
Reporting-only Google Ads API Client does not show any Ad Group performance data
in its interface, then it need not implement any of the "Ad Group"-level
Reporting RMF.
The above policy also applies to all other report types, though they are not
levels of the Google Ads hierarchy. Should you choose to implement any of these
reports, you must show all the required fields for each respective report.
In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, Google Ads API Client must display all
the columns marked required in the Object/Field/Guide column for each report, as
default. All other Metric columns must be made available,
as an option for users of the Google Ads API Client. Google Ads report data should be
reasonably prominent and accessible to end users.

## Downloadable Reports

If your tool provides a download option, for example a CSV, instead of
displaying reporting functionality within the user interface, then the download
link must be prominently displayed and intuitively labeled. The downloaded file
must contain all of the required reporting fields and be clearly labeled.

## Reporting Date Ranges

We recommend that you allow users to filter reporting data by date range. If
your tool doesn't support custom date ranges, then it should at least provide
the last 30 days of data for each required reporting field.

## Requirements for API Clients providing Creation Functionality or Management Functionality

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Full-Service Google Ads API Client
must implement all the required creation and management features in the table
below and show Reporting Functionality for each of the reports below.
Additionally, you must make reasonable effort to ensure that each of the
features is easily accessible and functional to end advertisers as measured by
the usage of those features.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Planning Services

If a Google Ads API Client provides any functionality related to KeywordPlanIdeaService
or KeywordPlanService, it must fully implement the required Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality and Reporting Functionality marked
"Required" in the table below.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Recommendation Service

All API clients are permitted to use GoogleAdsService and RecommendationService
to retrieve recommendations.
The use of RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation() and
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation() are limited to the following
types of Google Ads API Clients:
RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation()
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation()
Full-service tools
Internal-only tools
Shopping-only, Performance Max / Smart Shopping-only, App Promotion-only,
and Hotel-only API tools
Special purpose tools that offer campaign management functionality
If a Google Ads API Client offers the functionality to apply or dismiss recommendations
using RecommendationService, it must satisfy the following requirements:
It must fully implement the required Creation Functionality, Management
Functionality and Reporting Functionality for their tool category.
All Google Ads Recommendations shown to end users must be presented as
"Google Ads Recommendations" in the tool's UI.
End users must be able to view and apply all Google Ads Recommendations that
are surfaced by the Google Ads API Client.

## Requirements for Bid Adjustments

All API Clients providing Creation or Management functionality must satisfy the
following requirements related to bid adjustments:
End users must be allowed to input the entire range of allowable values.
End users must be able to review and edit the bid adjustments before it is
set by the Google Ads API Client.
Bid adjustments must be represented only as adjustments to bids, and may not
be used to enable or approximate other features, such as targeting or
exclusion.

## Feature Implementation

Unless otherwise specified below, a feature is implemented if and only if all
available sub-features and parameters are also implemented. The API
Reference documents which parameters and
sub-features are available. For example, the feature "Opt in/out of networks"
implies support for opting in/out of Google Search, search partners, and the
display network. Furthermore, if you implement in your Google Ads API Client a
feature similar to any feature not required by Google, you must then also
implement the similar Google feature in your Google Ads API Client. For example,
if you implement your own version of "Keyword Ideas" in your Google Ads API
Client, then you must also implement Google's "Keyword Ideas" functionality in
your Google Ads API Client.
To maintain RMF compliance, any new required features must be added by the due
date (shown next to each feature as Due: YYYY-MM-DD). Any RMFs with no
specified due date are past due. Additionally, we require that you send
screenshots and/or mockups of material proposed changes to the Google Ads API
Client, at least two weeks prior to these changes taking effect, using the Tool
Change form. For the sake of
clarity, after that two week period has elapsed, you do not need to wait for a
response from Google before those material changes take effect.

Google Ads API

# Required Minimum Functionality



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Required Minimum Functionality (RMF) refers to the features and other
functionality that certain tool developers must offer when using the Google Ads API. As
set forth below, RMF rules are grouped into three categories: Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality, and Reporting Functionality. Your
compliance with these rules depends on how you use the Google Ads API (an "RMF applies"
means that RMF applies to you):
Full-Service Tool
      
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
RMF applies

Reporting Only
      
only a reporting dashboard available to end-advertisers

RMF doesn't apply

Internal Use Only
      
individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to
tool (meaning you're the only one that uses your tool)
individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to
tool (meaning you're the only one that uses your tool)
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
If your tool offers very limited and specialized functionality, and could not be
used for creating and managing campaigns, ad groups, and ads, it may not qualify
as a full-service tool. In this case, the creation and management RMF would not
apply. If you're not sure whether the RMF policy applies to your tool, contact
the Google Ads API Compliance team. The
Google Ads API Compliance team will decide whether your tool is full-service or not.
Your tool may be reevaluated if the functionality changes significantly.
Note that RMF only applies to developer tokens with Standard access.

## One-Time Extension for Major Updates

In recognition of the fact that API tools may periodically perform extensive
technology upgrades, tools that have met all RMF deadlines for at least 2
consecutive years can apply for a 6 month RMF extension in order to implement
such upgrades to their platform. If the extension is granted, during the
extension period these tools will not be reviewed for compliance with RMF
requirements. At the end of the extension period, the tool must be in full
compliance with all RMF requirements that were due on or before the last date of
the extension period. All RMF requirements due after the end of the extension
will remain due on the date specified in the table below.
An API tool may be granted at most one extension every four years (the
second extension must start at least 4 years after the first one ends).
If you would like to apply for an extension for your tool, request an
application form by contacting us at
https://support.google.com/adspolicy/contact/contact_ads_api. Your application must be
signed and submitted by an executive (CEO, CTO or Senior VP) of your company.
Note that your application is not guaranteed to be approved.

## Requirements for Shopping-only, App Promotion-only and Hotel-only API Tools

If your tool is only designed to create and manage one of the following
campaign types, then you are only required to implement the Google Ads API creation and
management features and reports in the RMF that work with that campaign type.
App Promotion campaign
Hotel campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Performance Max campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Smart campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Standard Shopping campaigns

## Requirements for Reporting-only Google Ads API Clients

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Reporting-only Google Ads API
Client must show Reporting Functionality for each of the levels of the Google
Ads hierarchy displayed in its reporting interface. A level of the Google Ads
hierarchy means one of Account, Campaign, Ad Group, Ad or Keyword. For example,
if a Reporting-only Google Ads Client does show Ad Groups, then it must implement
all of the "Ad Group"-level Reporting Functionality that is labeled as
"Required" below.
A Reporting-only Google Ads API Client may choose not to show specific levels of
the Google Ads hierarchy in its reporting interface. For example, if a
Reporting-only Google Ads API Client does not show any Ad Group performance data
in its interface, then it need not implement any of the "Ad Group"-level
Reporting RMF.
The above policy also applies to all other report types, though they are not
levels of the Google Ads hierarchy. Should you choose to implement any of these
reports, you must show all the required fields for each respective report.
In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, Google Ads API Client must display all
the columns marked required in the Object/Field/Guide column for each report, as
default. All other Metric columns must be made available,
as an option for users of the Google Ads API Client. Google Ads report data should be
reasonably prominent and accessible to end users.

## Downloadable Reports

If your tool provides a download option, for example a CSV, instead of
displaying reporting functionality within the user interface, then the download
link must be prominently displayed and intuitively labeled. The downloaded file
must contain all of the required reporting fields and be clearly labeled.

## Reporting Date Ranges

We recommend that you allow users to filter reporting data by date range. If
your tool doesn't support custom date ranges, then it should at least provide
the last 30 days of data for each required reporting field.

## Requirements for API Clients providing Creation Functionality or Management Functionality

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Full-Service Google Ads API Client
must implement all the required creation and management features in the table
below and show Reporting Functionality for each of the reports below.
Additionally, you must make reasonable effort to ensure that each of the
features is easily accessible and functional to end advertisers as measured by
the usage of those features.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Planning Services

If a Google Ads API Client provides any functionality related to KeywordPlanIdeaService
or KeywordPlanService, it must fully implement the required Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality and Reporting Functionality marked
"Required" in the table below.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Recommendation Service

All API clients are permitted to use GoogleAdsService and RecommendationService
to retrieve recommendations.
The use of RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation() and
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation() are limited to the following
types of Google Ads API Clients:
RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation()
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation()
Full-service tools
Internal-only tools
Shopping-only, Performance Max / Smart Shopping-only, App Promotion-only,
and Hotel-only API tools
Special purpose tools that offer campaign management functionality
If a Google Ads API Client offers the functionality to apply or dismiss recommendations
using RecommendationService, it must satisfy the following requirements:
It must fully implement the required Creation Functionality, Management
Functionality and Reporting Functionality for their tool category.
All Google Ads Recommendations shown to end users must be presented as
"Google Ads Recommendations" in the tool's UI.
End users must be able to view and apply all Google Ads Recommendations that
are surfaced by the Google Ads API Client.

## Requirements for Bid Adjustments

All API Clients providing Creation or Management functionality must satisfy the
following requirements related to bid adjustments:
End users must be allowed to input the entire range of allowable values.
End users must be able to review and edit the bid adjustments before it is
set by the Google Ads API Client.
Bid adjustments must be represented only as adjustments to bids, and may not
be used to enable or approximate other features, such as targeting or
exclusion.

## Feature Implementation

Unless otherwise specified below, a feature is implemented if and only if all
available sub-features and parameters are also implemented. The API
Reference documents which parameters and
sub-features are available. For example, the feature "Opt in/out of networks"
implies support for opting in/out of Google Search, search partners, and the
display network. Furthermore, if you implement in your Google Ads API Client a
feature similar to any feature not required by Google, you must then also
implement the similar Google feature in your Google Ads API Client. For example,
if you implement your own version of "Keyword Ideas" in your Google Ads API
Client, then you must also implement Google's "Keyword Ideas" functionality in
your Google Ads API Client.
To maintain RMF compliance, any new required features must be added by the due
date (shown next to each feature as Due: YYYY-MM-DD). Any RMFs with no
specified due date are past due. Additionally, we require that you send
screenshots and/or mockups of material proposed changes to the Google Ads API
Client, at least two weeks prior to these changes taking effect, using the Tool
Change form. For the sake of
clarity, after that two week period has elapsed, you do not need to wait for a
response from Google before those material changes take effect.

Google Ads API

# Required Minimum Functionality



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Required Minimum Functionality (RMF) refers to the features and other
functionality that certain tool developers must offer when using the Google Ads API. As
set forth below, RMF rules are grouped into three categories: Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality, and Reporting Functionality. Your
compliance with these rules depends on how you use the Google Ads API (an "RMF applies"
means that RMF applies to you):
Full-Service Tool
      
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
advertisers, agencies, and other third parties use your tool to
fully manage their Google Ads accounts
RMF applies

Reporting Only
      
only a reporting dashboard available to end-advertisers

RMF doesn't apply

Internal Use Only
      
individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to
tool (meaning you're the only one that uses your tool)
individual advertiser or agency use only; no third-party access to
tool (meaning you're the only one that uses your tool)
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
RMF doesn't apply
If your tool offers very limited and specialized functionality, and could not be
used for creating and managing campaigns, ad groups, and ads, it may not qualify
as a full-service tool. In this case, the creation and management RMF would not
apply. If you're not sure whether the RMF policy applies to your tool, contact
the Google Ads API Compliance team. The
Google Ads API Compliance team will decide whether your tool is full-service or not.
Your tool may be reevaluated if the functionality changes significantly.
Note that RMF only applies to developer tokens with Standard access.

## One-Time Extension for Major Updates

In recognition of the fact that API tools may periodically perform extensive
technology upgrades, tools that have met all RMF deadlines for at least 2
consecutive years can apply for a 6 month RMF extension in order to implement
such upgrades to their platform. If the extension is granted, during the
extension period these tools will not be reviewed for compliance with RMF
requirements. At the end of the extension period, the tool must be in full
compliance with all RMF requirements that were due on or before the last date of
the extension period. All RMF requirements due after the end of the extension
will remain due on the date specified in the table below.
An API tool may be granted at most one extension every four years (the
second extension must start at least 4 years after the first one ends).
If you would like to apply for an extension for your tool, request an
application form by contacting us at
https://support.google.com/adspolicy/contact/contact_ads_api. Your application must be
signed and submitted by an executive (CEO, CTO or Senior VP) of your company.
Note that your application is not guaranteed to be approved.

## Requirements for Shopping-only, App Promotion-only and Hotel-only API Tools

If your tool is only designed to create and manage one of the following
campaign types, then you are only required to implement the Google Ads API creation and
management features and reports in the RMF that work with that campaign type.
App Promotion campaign
Hotel campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Performance Max campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Smart campaigns (available only in the Google Ads API)
Standard Shopping campaigns

## Requirements for Reporting-only Google Ads API Clients

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Reporting-only Google Ads API
Client must show Reporting Functionality for each of the levels of the Google
Ads hierarchy displayed in its reporting interface. A level of the Google Ads
hierarchy means one of Account, Campaign, Ad Group, Ad or Keyword. For example,
if a Reporting-only Google Ads Client does show Ad Groups, then it must implement
all of the "Ad Group"-level Reporting Functionality that is labeled as
"Required" below.
A Reporting-only Google Ads API Client may choose not to show specific levels of
the Google Ads hierarchy in its reporting interface. For example, if a
Reporting-only Google Ads API Client does not show any Ad Group performance data
in its interface, then it need not implement any of the "Ad Group"-level
Reporting RMF.
The above policy also applies to all other report types, though they are not
levels of the Google Ads hierarchy. Should you choose to implement any of these
reports, you must show all the required fields for each respective report.
In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, Google Ads API Client must display all
the columns marked required in the Object/Field/Guide column for each report, as
default. All other Metric columns must be made available,
as an option for users of the Google Ads API Client. Google Ads report data should be
reasonably prominent and accessible to end users.

## Downloadable Reports

If your tool provides a download option, for example a CSV, instead of
displaying reporting functionality within the user interface, then the download
link must be prominently displayed and intuitively labeled. The downloaded file
must contain all of the required reporting fields and be clearly labeled.

## Reporting Date Ranges

We recommend that you allow users to filter reporting data by date range. If
your tool doesn't support custom date ranges, then it should at least provide
the last 30 days of data for each required reporting field.

## Requirements for API Clients providing Creation Functionality or Management Functionality

In order to be compliant with RMF requirements, a Full-Service Google Ads API Client
must implement all the required creation and management features in the table
below and show Reporting Functionality for each of the reports below.
Additionally, you must make reasonable effort to ensure that each of the
features is easily accessible and functional to end advertisers as measured by
the usage of those features.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Planning Services

If a Google Ads API Client provides any functionality related to KeywordPlanIdeaService
or KeywordPlanService, it must fully implement the required Creation
Functionality, Management Functionality and Reporting Functionality marked
"Required" in the table below.

## Requirements for API Clients Providing Recommendation Service

All API clients are permitted to use GoogleAdsService and RecommendationService
to retrieve recommendations.
The use of RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation() and
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation() are limited to the following
types of Google Ads API Clients:
RecommendationService.ApplyRecommendation()
RecommendationService.DismissRecommendation()
Full-service tools
Internal-only tools
Shopping-only, Performance Max / Smart Shopping-only, App Promotion-only,
and Hotel-only API tools
Special purpose tools that offer campaign management functionality
If a Google Ads API Client offers the functionality to apply or dismiss recommendations
using RecommendationService, it must satisfy the following requirements:
It must fully implement the required Creation Functionality, Management
Functionality and Reporting Functionality for their tool category.
All Google Ads Recommendations shown to end users must be presented as
"Google Ads Recommendations" in the tool's UI.
End users must be able to view and apply all Google Ads Recommendations that
are surfaced by the Google Ads API Client.

## Requirements for Bid Adjustments

All API Clients providing Creation or Management functionality must satisfy the
following requirements related to bid adjustments:
End users must be allowed to input the entire range of allowable values.
End users must be able to review and edit the bid adjustments before it is
set by the Google Ads API Client.
Bid adjustments must be represented only as adjustments to bids, and may not
be used to enable or approximate other features, such as targeting or
exclusion.

## Feature Implementation

Unless otherwise specified below, a feature is implemented if and only if all
available sub-features and parameters are also implemented. The API
Reference documents which parameters and
sub-features are available. For example, the feature "Opt in/out of networks"
implies support for opting in/out of Google Search, search partners, and the
display network. Furthermore, if you implement in your Google Ads API Client a
feature similar to any feature not required by Google, you must then also
implement the similar Google feature in your Google Ads API Client. For example,
if you implement your own version of "Keyword Ideas" in your Google Ads API
Client, then you must also implement Google's "Keyword Ideas" functionality in
your Google Ads API Client.
To maintain RMF compliance, any new required features must be added by the due
date (shown next to each feature as Due: YYYY-MM-DD). Any RMFs with no
specified due date are past due. Additionally, we require that you send
screenshots and/or mockups of material proposed changes to the Google Ads API
Client, at least two weeks prior to these changes taking effect, using the Tool
Change form. For the sake of
clarity, after that two week period has elapsed, you do not need to wait for a
response from Google before those material changes take effect.

# Location Targeting



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

This guide describes location targeting, and how you can use the Google Ads API to add,
retrieve, and update location targeting for your campaigns.

## Why is geo targeting important?

Location targeting lets you serve ads to users in a particular geographical
region. For example, assume you're advertising for a chain of supermarkets.
Without location targeting, your ads would show in all regions worldwide, and
your ads might receive clicks from users in regions where you have no
supermarket locations. This generates cost while providing no possibility of a
return on the investment. With location targeting, your campaigns show ads only
in regions where you have open supermarkets. This approach also lets you
directly target customers searching locally for supermarkets.
The Google Ads API lets you target your ads by country, region, or proximity
around a specific geographical
point.
Learn more about
Targeting ads to geographic locations.

## Geo target campaigns for a region

You can target campaigns to any geographical region for which Google Ads
supports location targeting, such as a country, a state, a city, or a
postal region. Each targetable location is uniquely identified by a Criterion
ID. You can look up a criterion ID using
GeoTargetConstantService.SuggestGeoTargetConstants.
The resource_name of each GeoTargetConstant is
of the form geoTargetConstants/{Criterion ID}. For example, the
resource_name value of New York state is geoTargetConstants/21167.
GeoTargetConstantService.SuggestGeoTargetConstants
resource_name
GeoTargetConstant
geoTargetConstants/{Criterion ID}
resource_name
geoTargetConstants/21167
You can add geo targets to your campaigns using the
CampaignCriterionService. The following
code snippet shows how to target your campaign with a criterion ID.
CampaignCriterionService
Java
private static CampaignCriterion buildLocationIdCriterion(
    long locationId, String campaignResourceName) {
  Builder criterionBuilder = CampaignCriterion.newBuilder().setCampaign(campaignResourceName);

  criterionBuilder

      .setGeoTargetConstant(ResourceNames.geoTargetConstant(locationId));

# Conversion management



      
      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

A conversion in Google Ads is when a
user performs some specified action after clicking an ad or viewing a Display
Network ad. Conversions represent customer interactions vital to your
advertising goals, such as purchasing a product, installing a mobile app, or
signing up for an email list.
Conversion tracking provides
key insights into users' actions after viewing or clicking an ad. You can keep
track of users who call, buy a product, install a mobile app, and more.
The Google Ads API lets you programmatically manage the end-to-end workflow for
conversion management. The conversion management guide is divided into the
following sections that include creating conversions, importing offline
conversions, adjusting conversion values, monitoring the health of your
conversions, and grouping conversion actions into conversion goals.
